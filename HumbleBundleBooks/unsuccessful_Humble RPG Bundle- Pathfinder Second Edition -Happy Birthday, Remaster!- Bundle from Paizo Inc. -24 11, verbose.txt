HB Blurb: A Pathfinder Society Scenario designed for 5th- through 8th-level characters.The Pathfinder Society has had a tenuous relationship with the government of the ancient nation of Osirion ever since the Ruby Prince increased restrictions on the activities of foreign-based explorers. Venture-Captain Norden Balentiir has worked hard to restore the Society’s reputation in the nation, and to push the Sandswept Hall, the Pathfinder lodge in Osirion’s capital, away from its dark past.Recently, seemingly endless hordes of undead have been surging up from the depths of the Sandswept Hall. Norden Balentiir fears that knowledge of this threat from within the Society’s own lodge would compel the Ruby Prince to permanently shut down Pathfinder operations in Osirion. The lodge’s forces are locked in constant battle with the undead, and they need an experienced strike team to descend into the Hall’s lower levels and find the source of the undead menace!The Secluded Siege is part of the ongoing story of the Year of Shattered Sanctuaries. It is the first scenario in a two-part arc detailing the events befalling a Pathfinder Society lodge in the nation of Osirion. Other arcs explore other locations across the Inner Sea. While the arcs can be played in any order, it is recommended that players experience the scenarios within each individual arc in order.

HB Blurb: A Pathfinder Society Scenario designed for 3rd- through 6th-level characters.The Pathfinder Society has sent the PCs to the city of Oppara, capital of Taldor, for a clandestine meeting with Gloriana Morilla, a trusted ally who bears dire news. She reports that Venture-Captain Muesello has gone into hiding following a strange series of crimes during which the perpetrators used wayfinders, the magical compasses that are among the Pathfinders' most iconic tools. Perhaps more troubling, these wayfinders each bear signs of Muesello's unique tinkering, and all of the crimes have targeted the assets and allies of Grand Princess Eutropia Stavian, the nation's new monarch.With the crime spree steadily escalating and Muesello suspiciously evading her agents at every turn, Gloriana Morilla needs a group of skilled Pathfinders to investigate the recent crimes and track down the wayward venture-captain.No Time for Treason is part of the ongoing story of the Year of Shattered Sanctuaries.

HB Blurb: A Pathfinder Society Scenario designed for 3rd- through 6th-level characters.Heed the call for heroes!After assisting the people of Port Valen and protecting the town from rampaging trolls, the Society earned the approval of the settlement's leaders to establish a new Pathfinder lodge in the former feasting hall of the legendary warrior Sveinn Blood-Eagle. After enduring several months of dangerous ocean voyages to supply the new lodge and assist the town, venture-captains Bjersig Torrsen and Calisro Bennary requested permission for the Society to connect their new lodge in Port Valen to the Maze of the Open Road. By using the mystical extraplanar hedge maze, the venture-captains hope to strengthen the Society's presence in Arcadia. Rather than establish such a connection on their own, the venture-captains consulted Port Valen's leaders to determine the most responsible means of opening the portal. Their careful research brought them to a fey guardian in the Forest of Trials. The guardian readily agreed to the Society's proposal, on one condition. To keep the portal opened, the Society must regularly send heroes to perform heroic deeds in and around the Forest of Trials!In this repeatable scenario, the PCs visit Port Valen and perform a series of deeds to earn the approval of the forest guardian. The scenario includes variable elements to ensure continued enjoyment for those who wish to play or run the adventure multiple times.

HB Blurb: A Pathfinder Society Scenario designed for 5th- through 8th-level characters.When Venture-Captain Norden Balentiir learned that hordes of undead were rising from beneath his own lodge, the Sandswept Hall of Sothis, he feared that calling for help from Osirion's government would anger the Ruby Prince, resulting in the lodge being shuttered for good. Instead, he called for an elite team of Pathfinder agents to strike back against the undead incursion and find the source of the unrelenting horde. Thanks to this team's successful efforts, the Society knows how the undead are entering the lodge—but not how to stop them for good. Multiple Pathfinder agents have attempted to scout beyond the breach in the vaults of the Sandswept Hall, but thus far, they've learned little—and several haven't returned at all. Now, the venture-captain has called on another elite team to venture into unknown territory, rescue their lost companions, and put a stop to the attacks, once and for all.The Tomb Between Worlds is part of the ongoing story of the Year of Shattered Sanctuaries. It is the second scenario in a two-part arc detailing the events befalling a Pathfinder Society lodge in the nation of Osirion.

Gloriana Morilla, a trusted ally and former Pathfinder leader, has concocted a plan to draw out the Society’s enemies. For her plan to work, she’s going to need agents who are willing to take some risks, as there’s no telling what sinister forces might be responsible for the recent crimes in Oppara.The plan starts like this: first, try to flee the city… but make sure they see you doing it!Escape from Oppara is part of the ongoing Taldor metaplot arc in the Year of Shattered Sanctuaries.

And what is the nature of the vision that beckons you to a small game store in Absalom’s Grand Bazaar?

Can you stop them in time?
 
 Inside the Stolen Fate Player’s Guide, you’ll find player-friendly, spoiler-free information and tips to help you make an exciting new character perfect for the Stolen Fate Adventure Path—including rules for the first four magical harrow cards you’ll start the campaign with!

HB Blurb: A Pathfinder Society Quest designed for 1st- through 4th-level characters, playable in 2-3 hours.
 
 An Aldori swordlord who fought alongside Pathfinders years ago is looking for a way to push her students harder. She issues a challenge to Marcos Farabellus, the Master of Swords, boasting that her most promising young pupils can defeat any Marcos has trained. She stakes her pride as a teacher and a powerful weapon she used during the Fifth Crusade on the outcome. Marcos both believes such a relic, taken to the very heart of the Worldwound, would be an excellent addition to the Society's vaults and that the PCs are the perfect students on which to stake his own pride. The PCs must do their utmost to justify the faith he has placed in them and win a great victory-- and perhaps a new ally-- for the Pathfinder Society.
