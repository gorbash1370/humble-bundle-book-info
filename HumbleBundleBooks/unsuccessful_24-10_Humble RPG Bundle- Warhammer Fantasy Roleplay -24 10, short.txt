HB Blurb: To the north lies the bitterly cold and tempestuous Sea of Claws. The sea separates the Empire from the lands of Norsca, where Marauder tribes beseech the forces of Chaos for glory and power and vast monsters make their lairs in the fjords. The coastal provinces of the Empire, desperate to escape the stranglehold of Marienburg, scramble to construct mighty navies and sea defences. Sailors, explorers, pirates, and wreckers all rub their hands in thought of the wealth to be won — but whilst a life on the ocean waves can reap great rewards, the risks are greater still.

HB Blurb: PERILOUS ADVENTURES IN A MYSTERIOUS CONTINENTFar from the shores of the Old World, across the Great Ocean, is the mysterious continent of Lustria. Tales tell of troves of golden treasure and repositories of arcane lore ready for the taking by those bold enough to risk it. Each week it seems that another ship full of hopeful adventurers departs to this new world on a voyage of exploration.But those who make landfall on the shores of Lustria find themselves in an environment that is wholly inimical to warm-blooded life. The jungles seethe with venomous snakes, carnivorous lizards, poisonous flora, and deadly disease. The few precarious settlements that cling to the coast arouse the ire of Lustria’s oldest inhabitants, the Lizardmen, who sally forth from their temple-cities to destroy all who encroach on their territory.

Her letters find their way to every corner of the Empire. Each missive begs its recipient to reply with thoughts on some specific matter.

Behind its imposing walls, troubled souls receive succour, and a lucky few find respite.One of its denizens, the ‘Lady’ Isabella, worries her carers. Her quill is ceaseless, though few can say what she writes. Despite the best efforts of the hospice staff, strange missives continue to appear in her room. Could there be some truth to her claim that she is collating a truly wondrous collection of writings?Surely it can not be the case that she is who she claims to be — one Princess Isabella von Holswig-Schleistein, sister to Emperor Karl-Franz I.

Published Date:

HB Blurb: ARCHIVES OF THE EMPIRE: VOLUME III - A GRIM AND PERILOUS EXPLORATION OF THE EMPIREIsabella, inmate of the Great Hospice and, if she is to be believed, sister to the Emperor, has compiled a new treatise on diverse matters of import and interest to the folk of the Empire. It seems Isabella has turned her mind to the concerns of business and the practice of obscure religions (or, in the case of the cult of Handrich, a bit of both!). Her research into ancient beliefs has led her to ruminate on the similarities and distinctions between the cult of the Old Faith, the worship of Rhya, and the practice of hedge witchery, including updated material on the background of such traditions, and the techniques used by their priests and practitioners. She ruminates on how adventurers with a bit of cash to spare might branch out into legitimate business, and how such decisions may lead to further adventures in turn. She has also turned her attention to the trade of the armourer, and considers the problems and benefits involved in a suit of armour. She also turns her attention back to matters in Ubersreik, detailing the personality and attributes of one Lord Adalbert Knopp-Itzel, a semi-retired knight of the Reiksguard who seems set on restoring the reputation of the Jungfreuds.

Published Date: 
---
HB Blurb: From the shattered warpgates at the poles of the world raw energies of Chaos flow into the world, powering works of sorcery and sustaining Daemonic entities. This is magic in a pure but unstable form. Thanks to the wise counsel of Teclis, greatest of the High Elf Mages, Human wizards have learned to draw upon a single facet to work with a form of sorcery which is relatively safe, but still capable of feats of vast power. These isolated strands of raw magical energy are known as the Winds of Magic. Winds of Magic is a comprehensive guide to the practices and traditions taught by the eight Colleges of Magic. As well as providing background to the development of magic in the Empire it includes details of a multitude of magic practices, creatures, and places.

HB Blurb: Frau Vera Warnicke — It is with great pleasure that I write to inform you that I have at last received funding to commission the expeditions of which we lately spoke. Indeed, I expect that our patron should extend his largess to pay for not one, but three trips into the wild places of the Empire and beyond in pursuit of knowledge. I trust that those individuals you spoke of are available, and that they should be just as competent as you promised. I mean no mere foray into the hinterlands, to be back in time for supper in the University. These shall be true explorations of the deepest depths there are, for only the most impressive specimens could hope to excite those jaded academics of the Imperial Zoo.   The Imperial Zoo is a bestiary and travelogue of three daring expeditions into the Old World, ranging from the heights of Karak Kadrin to the city of Miragliano in the southern land of Tilea. It includes profiles for over 60 unique creatures, beasts and monsters of the Old World perfect to challenge even the most competent of adventurers. Also included are six new pregenerated Characters, each with their own skills, talents, and shady past, perfect to pick up and dive into a campaign focused on the truly mammoth threats that stalk the Old World.

Author(s): Cubicle 7
---
ISBN-10:  - ISBN-13:  - ASIN: 0857443666
Published Date: 
---
HB Blurb: Altdorf is the capital city of the Empire and the birthplace of Sigmar Heldenhammer. It is the most populous city in the Old World, and the site of several famous and majestic landmarks. The Imperial Palace and the Grand Cathedral of Sigmar are monumental edifices, larger than whole districts of smaller cities. The Colleges of Magic tower over the banks of fog that blow in off the Reik, venting gouts of sorcerous fire and fume. Altdorf has another side to it, in the teeming rookeries of the East End and the bustling Dockland to the north, gangland intimidation and revolutionary fervour are felt more keenly than the word of Sigmar’s priests, or the rule of the Emperor’s laws.

Book 10:

HB Blurb: Whilst the chaos of the Turmoil subsides, an invigorated Empire seeks to leave civil strife behind and look towards the future. All eyes turn to Salzenmund in hope that it may provide opportunity and secure the Empire’s coastline. It is a city of significant riches, for the nearby Silver Hills are abundant in precious metal and trade flows in from the Sea of Claws to the north. Cosmopolitan and vibrant, the cults of Sigmar, Manann and Ulric flourish here in relative harmony.Salzenmund promises opportunity and excitement to adventurous souls. Explorers depart from the city to trade with fur-clad Norscans or brave the wide sea to Lustria. But the ruling Gausser family, newly installed and ambitious, threaten the stability of the Empire. The head of the family talks of a reconquest of the Wasteland and defiance of their old masters in Middenheim. In the taverns by the docks, vicious and crooked folk conspire in smuggling and piracy. Worse still, the honeyed whispers of forbidden cults entice the truly desperate into the worship of Chaos.

Published Date: 
---
HB Blurb: Famed for its impregnability, set atop the mighty Fauschlag, struck flat by Ulric’s fist, Middenheim commands authority over all who stand beneath its towering presence. Hewn from living rock by peerless Dwarf skill, it is a striking fortress city where Ulric, the God of War, Winter and Wolves, reigns supreme. The sacred Eternal Flame burns pure and bright, in the heart of a city famed throughout the Old World, riven by dark cults, clambering merchants, and seditious schemers. Middenheim has little room for heroes, and less time for wasters, but for canny opportunists with the will and grit to carve a small piece of something better? Well, they might stand a chance.Middenheim: City of the White Wolf takes players out of the familiar Grand Province of the Reikland, and drops them in the centre of Ulrican influence and power in the Old World. Middenheim sits at the heart of the Empire’s Northern expanse, and is the perfect setting for endless grim and perilous adventure! Each district of the expansive city is carefully detailed, with locations, plot hooks and NPCs too numerous to list. A beautifully illustrated map, provided with both GM and Player versions, shows off the city in exquisite detail. Need an Inn in the Altmarket? A Pawnbroker in The Kleinmoot? Details on the Kisvilite Embassy? Middenheim has everything you require.

HB Blurb: Ubersreik is a city in turmoil, riven with divided loyalties. Even those who support the rule of Altdorf know that the current situation cannot last. As rumours of Empire-shaking events filter in from Middenheim, Altdorf, and beyond, the case for a consolidation of power in Ubersreik grows stronger. In the midst of vying merchants, entitled nobles, callous spies, and outright thugs, a small group of adventurers and mercenaries have made a name for themselves. They have been arrested, enlisted, applauded as saviours, reviled as traitors, and dismissed as fools. But if they can also be ruthless, they may just be able to tip the machinations that will determine the fate of Ubersreik.Ubersreik Adventures II contains five all new adventures, along with a chapter expanding on events in the City of Ubersreik, the setting established in the WFRP Starter Set. It explores the fate of the city, as it teters between direct Imperial control, the influence of the Jungfrueds, and perhaps a glimpse of a more independent future. This section introduces new characters, locations and plots, and provides suggestions and advice on incorporating developments your characters may have experienced (or caused!) during the events of The Enemy Within campaign.

Published Date: 
---
HB Blurb: The Empire is a sea of trees and wilderness, punctuated by all too seldom islands of civilisation and security. Its roads are winding, muddy tracks, plagued by bandits and worse. No wonder then that most who can afford it travel by river barge, and the waterways of the Reikland are alive with trade, travel, crime and adventure. Most major settlements of the Empire are built upon the banks of one of the great rivers that flow through the nation. Together these rivers form an extensive network, tying the vast Empire together.Something Knocking takes place on just such an artery of trade and trouble. A band of pirates has been the cause of a great deal of trouble along a stretch of the river, and strange phenomenon has been linked to their activities. The Characters may have to form an unlikely alliance and dip into the murky waters of folklore and magic to solve a mystery and bring the reavers to justice.

HB Blurb: The Garden of Morr is the ultimate levelling ground for the great, the good, and the grubby. Regardless of rank or social status, there is room in Morr’s realm for all those who shuffle, march, or otherwise stumble off this mortal coil. Granted, some of these graves are a little less well presented than others, and the space given over to paupers is little better than a pit, but even so…When news of the passing of the beloved Doktor Albrecht Ledermann began to circulate, those grateful souls whose lives he had saved over his 40 year career began to gather together in mourning. Unfortunate, then, that the Countess Elise von Fürstenrecht should choose about the same time to take her own parting from the world. Both groups of mourners throng the graveyard, and more than one shifty looking individual can be spotted, each pursuing their own agenda while arguments rage over who should be laid to rest first. Can the Characters brave the twisting parallel threads of intrigue that flow throughout the day’s events, or will they be left puzzled by the plethora of cold bodies, open graves, forgotten heirs and hidden threats? Well, It’s Your Funeral...

HB Blurb: To ease the long, harsh days of a relentless winter, folk living in remote, mountainous wild areas seek comfort and joy in the celebration of ancient traditions and the worship of their gods. Often gathering with family and friends, Mondstille is still an important occasion, providing necessary respite from the harsh conditions raging outside.While the days are short and the dark nights seem interminable, midwinter is an important point in any calendar, especially for those remembering their legends and traditions. Ulric holds dominion over winter, but Taal is remembered as the wild takes on an aspect of greater savagery in the cold months, and Rhya is beseeched, to return vigour and vitality to the world.In the remote mining town of Kupfertal, the Lurchen family are willing to extend their hospitality to those who would otherwise suffer in the harsh, bleak and biting winter cold. Roving Goblins threaten those who stray too far from the warmth of their Taal Logs. Feasts, blessings and games warm the hearts of the Lurchens, but despite the Mondstille cheer, old ghosts of feast days’ past make a timely appearance and skeletons come out of the closet. So light up a candle, ignore the voices down the corridor, and make sure you don’t let the fire go out!

Published Date: 
---
HB Blurb: When Teclis decided to instruct the humans of the Empire in the use of magic, there was much grumbling. Some thought it madness; while others saw the grim necessity of it. However, the Elf High Mage Sullasara saw it as an excellent opportunity to educate the Empire’s unfortunates in the ways of their betters. To this end, she scribed a short grimoire of useful magics, taken from each of the eight lores taught at the colleges Teclis founded, and had it translated into Reikspeil. Sullasara chose spells that she felt were safe, useful, and would have as little use on the battlefield as possible.The Wizards of the Empire have been abusing these magics ever since.

Title: Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay Blood & Bramble
Author(s): Cubicle 7

ISBN-10:  - ISBN-13:  - ASIN: 0857443356
Published Date: 
---
HB Blurb: Before ever Teclis pondered the notion of Human wizards, and long before Magnus the Pious laid the foundation for the Colleges of Magic, there was still magic in the land that would become the Empire. To the Witch Hunter it is all base witchery, and its practitioners worthy of little consideration and a good deal of kindling. Those who know a little better recognise that there are distinctions to be made. Witchcraft is the shortest path to power, be it ever so soaked in blood, while the Lore of Hedgecraft is more subtle, its many paths disappearing into the brambles at the edge of civilisation. Which sounds more appealing? Come closer, and learn for yourself... Blood and Bramble is a collection of 24 new spells, a dozen each from the lores of Witchcraft and Hedgecraft. These spells expand the offering found in the core book substantially, and greatly expand the capabilities of non-college practitioners.
