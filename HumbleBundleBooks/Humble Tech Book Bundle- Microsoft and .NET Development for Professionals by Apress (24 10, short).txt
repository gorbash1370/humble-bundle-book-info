HB Blurb: Understand the power of dynamic arrays: a single formula can generate new and vastly more efficient spreadsheet possibilities. This book introduces spreadsheet users to dynamic array functions in Microsoft Excel 365, defines and details the distinctive ways in which they work, and shows how they can be applied to a wide swath of data-analytic tasks.While array formulas and functions have long held a place in the spreadsheet toolbox (although, for many of us, shunted to an obscure corner), the dynamic array engine offers a more user-friendly and intelligible set of means for manipulating spreadsheet data in the array mode. The single-formula, multi-cell capability of dynamic arrays has been extended to nearly all existing spreadsheet functions, offering a new, default way of working. As a result, many tasks can now be executed with dynamic arrays without having to resort to the new functions at all.After defining arrays and dynamic array formulas, this book helps you examine the dynamic array property of lifting and how it impacts the formulas, including those written with existing functions. Plenty of illustrations and formulas along the way help you get comfortable using them. From there, you will learn Excel 365’s new dynamic functions, including the 14 currently in rollout, each accompanied by instructive examples. In many cases, the examples demonstrate how the new functions can work with long-available functions, such as MID, IF, COUNTIF, etc., which now also boast dynamic array functionality.   What You Will LearnUnlock the dynamic array potential in Microsoft ExcelApply dynamic array functions and confidently direct them to real-world spreadsheet tasksKnow the distinctive ways in which arrays work and can be applied to numerous data-analytic tasks Who This Book Is ForUsers of Excel 365 and beyond who are comfortable with, but not necessarily expert in, formula writing, as well as those who are unaware of or not fluent with dynamic arrays.

Title: The Art of Immutable Architecture, 2nd edition
Author(s): Michael L. Perry

ISBN-10:  - ISBN-13:  - ASIN: 1484259548
Published Date: 
---
HB Blurb: This book teaches you how to evaluate a distributed system from the perspective of immutable objects. You will understand the problems in existing designs, know how to make small modifications to correct those problems, and learn to apply the principles of immutable architecture to your tools. Most software components focus on the state of objects. They store the current state of a row in a relational database. They track changes to state over time, making several basic assumptions: there is a single latest version of each object, the state of an object changes sequentially, and a system of record exists. This is a challenge when it comes to building distributed systems. Whether dealing with autonomous microservices or disconnected mobile apps, many of the problems we try to solve come down to synchronizing an ever-changing state between isolated components. Distributed systems would be a lot easier to build if objects could not change. After reading The Art of Immutable Architecture, you will come away with an understanding of the benefits of using immutable objects in your own distributed systems. You will learn a set of rules for identifying and exchanging immutable objects, and see a collection of useful theorems that emerges and ensures that the distributed systems you build are eventually consistent. Using patterns, you will find where the truth converges, see how changes are associative, rather than sequential, and come to feel comfortable understanding that there is no longer a single source of truth. Practical hands-on examples reinforce how to build software using the described patterns, techniques, and tools. By the end of the book, you will possess the language and resources needed to analyze and construct distributed systems with confidence.  The assumptions of the past were sufficient for building single-user, single-computer systems. But aswe expand to multiple devices, shared experiences, and cloud computing, they work against us. It is time for a new set of assumptions. Start with immutable objects, and build better distributed systems.  What You Will LearnEvaluate a distributed system from the perspective of immutable objects  Recognize the problems in existing designs, and make small modifications to correct them Start a new system from scratch, applying patternsApply the principles of immutable architecture to your tools, including SQL databases, message queues, and the network protocols that you already use Discover new tools that natively apply these principles  Who This Book Is For Software architects and senior developers. It contains examples in SQL and languages such as JavaScript and C#. Past experience with distributed computing, data modeling, or business analysis is helpful.

HB Blurb: This book is for enterprise and solution architects, systems integrators, and anyone managing enterprise-scale, multi-cloud or hybrid IT landscapes. The book examines usage of Azure Arc for governance and systems management with security as an overarching theme. It is not an implementation manual but provides high-level guidance on best practices and links to detailed guidance. It offers insight into the types of problems that Azure Arc can solve, and will help you determine whether it is the right choice for your organization. Modern enterprise computing is an astonishing luxury land filled with never-before-seen hosting options on commercial clouds as well as advancements in the areas of private cloud and edge computing. The challenge with this plethora of choices is to manage and coordinate large IT estates which may bridge multiple public clouds and private datacenters. Visibility of operations to achieve security, cost control, and efficiency is often difficult to achieve. Data management is another area which is particularly fraught with complexity and risk. Industry leaders have made serious investments in the design of control plane products to address these gaps with varying approaches and degrees of success. Azure Arc is designed to provide a consolidated view of assets such as databases and Kubernetes installations across major cloud providers, edge locations, and customer-owned datacenters. It facilitates deployment of new infrastructure, patching and upgrades, monitoring, policy, and security controls for assets living on-premises or in competitor clouds as if they were native to Azure. While competitive products exist, at this writing none have the flexibility and reach of Arc to effectively manage very large hybrid estates. Readers will appreciate the author’s approach of walking through typical enterprise computing scenarios while listing industry- or scenario-specific challenges that are difficult to overcome, and then reinforcing understanding by restating the challenges while explaining how Azure Arc can be utilized to remediate them. What You Will LearnDiscover what Azure Arc is, the types of problems it is intended to solve, and how to map your requirements to its capabilitiesStreamline and secure large Arc-enabled Kubernetes deployments via modern GitOps practicesUse Azure Arc to consolidate management across a broad range of hybrid and multi-cloud ecosystems through policy-driven governanceApply monitoring and automation to defend systems against security threats that are beyond the ability of manual administration to deflectUncover practical guidance that is written in a way that makes basic precepts approachable to non-technical stakeholders and then branches out into areas that will offer advanced readers new insights and consolidate a broad topic into a usable directionWho This BookIs For Enterprise and solution architects, systems integrators, and anyone else looking to solve enterprise-scale administration problems across a multi-cloud or hybrid architecture

Additionally, you will find useful techniques and an explanation of the differences between writing code in two different styles. It also covers the new templates introduced in .NET 6, along with usage of .NET 7 in Windows 10 to write code and generate output.  Each chapter opens with an introduction and original application written in C# 11 so that you can jump right into coding. From there, you are guided through an expected output and taught best practices along the way. Author Vaskaran Sarcar emphasizes extending and maintaining the same program and he demonstrates examples for different scenarios to make your program more efficient and effective. This book is divided into five parts. The first part starts with a detailed discussion of polymorphism. It then shows you how to make proper use of abstract classes and interfaces, and teaches you to discern which technique to use for a specific scenario. Discussions on code comments teach you how to use them effectively, and why you need to be careful with code comments. In the second part you will learn six design principles, including SOLID and DRY principles. These are the foundation of well-known design patterns, and they establish practices for developing software with considerations for maintaining and extending as a project grows. The third part walks you through methods to make efficient applications. You will learn the common use of factories to separate code from its opposite and the alternative of inheritance using object composition and wrappers. This part also demonstrates the use of template methods, hooks, and facades in programming.Hints show you how professional coders develop an enterprise application. Better handling of exceptions and null values is another integral part of professional programming, which the fourth part explores in detail. This will help you become a more professional programmer. In the final part of the book, you will learn about effective memory management techniques and the use and misuse of design patterns. This part also briefly discusses how to decide between a static method and an instance method and other techniques.
