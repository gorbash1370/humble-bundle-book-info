HB Blurb: Strengthen your overall coding skills by exploring the wonderful, wild, and often weird world of esoteric languages (esolangs).Strange Code starts with a dive into the underlying history of programming, covering the early computer-science concepts, like Turing machines and Turing completeness, that led to the languages we use today. It then explores the realm of “atypical” programming languages, introducing you to the out-of-the-box thinking that comes from these unusual approaches to coding.Later chapters address the even more unusual esolangs, nearly all of which are like nothing you’ve ever seen. Finally, author Ron Kneusel helps you develop and use two entirely new programming languages. You may not apply these languages in your day job, but this one-of-a-kind book will motivate you to think differently about what it means to express thought through code, while discovering the far-flung boundaries of programming.You'll learn:How to program with pictures using PietHow to write two-dimensional programs in BefungeHow to implement machine-learning algorithms using the text pattern matching language SNOBOLHow to decipher Brainfuck code like [->-[>+>>]>[[-]+>+>>]How to design and create two original programming languagesLearning to think in these languages will make you a better, more confident programmer.

HB Blurb: Bare Metal C will teach you how to program embedded devices with the C programming language. For embedded system programmers who want precise and complete control over the system they are using, this book pulls back the curtain on what the compiler is doing for you so that you can see all the details of what's happening with your program.The first part of the book teaches C basics with the aid of a low-cost, widely available bare metal system (the Nucleo Arm evaluation system), which gives you all the tools needed to perform basic embedded programming. As you progress through the book you’ll learn how to integrate serial input/output (I/O) and interrupts into your programs. You’ll also learn what the C compiler and linker do behind the scenes, so that you’ll be better able to write more efficient programs that maximize limited memory. Finally, you’ll learn how to use more complex, memory hungry C features like dynamic memory, file I/O, and floating-point numbers.

HB Blurb: The thing works like this.Many coders are unfamiliar with the underlying technologies that make their programs run. But why should you care when your code appears to work? Because you want it to run well and not be riddled with hard-to-find bugs. You don’t want to be in the news because your code had a security problem.Lots of technical detail is available online but it’s not organized or collected into a convenient place. In The Secret Life of Programs, veteran engineer Jonathan E. Steinhart explores—in depth—the foundational concepts that underlie the machine. Subjects like computer hardware, how software behaves on hardware, as well as how people have solved problems using technology over time.You’ll learn:How the real world is converted into a form that computers understand, like bits, logic, numbers, text, and colorsThe fundamental building blocks that make up a computer including logic gates, adders, decoders, registers, and memoryWhy designing programs to match computer hardware, especially memory, improves performanceHow programs are converted into machine language that computers understandHow software building blocks are combined to create programs like web browsersClever tricks for making programs more efficient, like loop invariance, strength reduction, and recursive subdivisionThe fundamentals of computer security and machine intelligenceProject design, documentation, scheduling, portability, maintenance, and other practical programming realities.Learn what really happens when your code runs on the machine and you’ll learn to craft better, more efficient code.

HB Blurb: The GNU Autotools make it easy for developers to create software that is portable across many Unix-like operating systems, and even Windows. Although the Autotools are used by thousands of open source software packages, they have a notoriously steep learning curve.Autotools is the first book to offer programmers a tutorial-based guide to the GNU build system. Author John Calcote begins with an overview of high-level concepts and a hands-on tour of the philosophy and design of the Autotools. He then tackles more advanced details, like using the M4 macro processor with Autoconf, extending the framework provided by Automake, and building Java and C# sources. He concludes with solutions to frequent problems encountered by Autotools users.This thoroughly revised second edition has been updated to cover the latest versions of the Autotools. It includes five new chapters on topics like pkg-config, unit and integration testing with Autotest, internationalizing with GNU tools, the portability of gnulib, and using the Autotools with Windows. As with the first edition, you'll focus on two projects: Jupiter, a simple “Hello, world!” program, and FLAIM, an existing, complex open source effort containing four separate but interdependent projects. Follow along as the author takes Jupiter’s build system from a basic makefile to a full-fledged Autotools project, and then as he converts the FLAIM projects from complex, hand-coded makefiles to the powerful and flexible GNU build system.Learn how to:Master the Autotools build system to maximize your software’s portabilityGenerate Autoconf configuration scripts to simplify the compilation processProduce portable makefiles with AutomakeBuild cross-platform software libraries with LibtoolWrite your own Autoconf macrosThis detailed introduction to the GNU Autotools is indispensable for developers and programmers looking to gain a deeper understanding of this complex suite of tools. Stop fighting against the system and make sense of it all with the second edition of Autotools!

HB Blurb: For new software engineers, knowing how to program is only half the battle. You’ll quickly find that many of the skills and processes key to your success are not taught in any school or bootcamp.The Missing README fills in that gap—a distillation of workplace lessons, best practices, and engineering fundamentals that the authors have taught rookie developers at top companies for more than a decade.Early chapters explain what to expect when you begin your career at a company. The book’s middle section expands your technical education, teaching you how to work with existing codebases, address and prevent technical debt, write production-grade software, manage dependencies, test effectively, do code reviews, safely deploy software, design evolvable architectures, and handle incidents when you’re on-call. Additional chapters cover planning and interpersonal skills such as Agile planning, working effectively with your manager, and growing to senior levels and beyond.You’ll learn:How to use the legacy code change algorithm, and leave code cleaner than you found itHow to write operable code with logging, metrics, configuration, and defensive programmingHow to write deterministic tests, submit code reviews, and give feedback on other people’s codeThe technical design process, including experiments, problem definition, documentation, and collaborationWhat to do when you are on-call, and how to navigate production incidentsArchitectural techniques that make code change easierAgile development practices like sprint planning, stand-ups, and retrospectivesThis is the book your tech lead wishes every new engineer would read before they start. By the end, you’ll know what it takes to transition into the workplace–from CS classes or bootcamps to professional software engineering.

HB Blurb: Ruby is a powerful programming language with a focus on simplicity, but beneath its elegant syntax it performs countless unseen tasks.
Ruby Under a Microscope gives you a hands-on look at Ruby’s core, using extensive diagrams and thorough explanations to show you how Ruby is implemented (no C skills required). Author Pat Shaughnessy takes a scientific approach, laying out a series of experiments with Ruby code to take you behind the scenes of how programming languages work. You’ll even find information on JRuby and Rubinius (two alternative implementations of Ruby), as well as in-depth explorations of Ruby’s garbage collection algorithm.
Ruby Under a Microscope will teach you:

How a few computer science concepts underpin Ruby’s complex implementation
How Ruby executes your code using a virtual machine
How classes and modules are the same inside Ruby
How Ruby employs algorithms originally developed for Lisp
How Ruby uses grammar rules to parse and understand your code
How your Ruby code is translated into a different language by a compiler

No programming language needs to be a black box. Whether you’re already intrigued by language implementation or just want to dig deeper into Ruby, you’ll find Ruby Under a Microscope a fascinating way to become a better programmer.Covers Ruby 2.x, 1.9 and 1.8
