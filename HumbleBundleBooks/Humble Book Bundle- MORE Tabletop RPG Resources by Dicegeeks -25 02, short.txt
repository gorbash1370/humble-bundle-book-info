The ideas are organized by a broad topic and are placed in a random table format. Each table has one hundred ideas. You can use these adventure ideas to run RPG sessions in several ways. You can read through the tables and choose an idea. You can take several ideas and combine them into one scenario for a campaign. You can roll randomly on a table to find an adventure on the fly. You can also use these ideas as side quests within original or premade campaigns. The first six tables contain ideas that range from story hooks to scenarios to globe-spanning adventures. These tables are organized under the topics: Dungeons Hooks, Royal Quests, Forest Quests, Doorways to Another World, Town Quests, and Sea Quests. The next three tables are as follows: Questing Beasts, Quest Objects, and Lost Cities. Here you will find the name of a thing and a bit of context. These are meant to be used as the goal of the quest. How the goal is attained is up to the gamemaster. Meta-Quests is the last table in the book.

HB Blurb: Like the first two books in the series, this book is meant to help the dungeon masters and game masters of fantasy tabletop role-playing games save time. Preparing RPG campaigns and sessions can be taxing, and sometimes a spark is needed to light the creative fires. DMs and GMs always need clever hooks and stories to launch their players on fantastic adventures. These quest and adventure ideas can be used in a couple of different ways. First, they can be used as the main objective of a campaign. Second, they can be used as side quests or rumors during a larger campaign. To help use the ideas in either of these ways, the quests range from simple to complex. This range gives DMs flexibility in crafting sessions. The adventure ideas have been arranged in random tables so dungeon masters can roll percentile dice to discover quests. The element of randomness in tabletop RPGs often brings out the most fascinating and engaging stories. As game masters and players add to the seed provided, unique tales emerge. The quests are categorized by different themes: Apocalyptic, Espionage, Fey, Gnome, Maps, Messages, Quest Givers, Ranger, Sky, and Thieves Guild. Death and destruction reign in the Apocalyptic section. Gear up for spy action with the Espionage quests. Journey in the fair country with ideas in the Fey table. Spent some time with the little folk exploring the Gnome quests. In the Maps table, game masters can give their players a unique map that leads to high adventure. The Messages section provides special deliveries for hints and clues characters need. People need jobs done and one hundred of those people are found in the Quest Givers section. Rangers got to range with the variety of quests on the next table. Take to the skies with Sky quests. Get sneaky with quests suited for the Thieves Guild. With these one thousand adventure ideas, you will never have a lull at the gaming table. Flip to any page, roll your dice and get ready for adventures you and your players will never forget.

HB Blurb: These random tables are geared toward far-future role-playing games. The game master can roll percentile dice for a result or have players roll. No matter how you choose to use the tables, they will cut down GM prep time. The first section is Cargo Runs. This massive table has one hundred different cargo runs including origin to destination planet, employer name, and complications. Always have a run handy when your players decide to make extra credits by hauling cargo. Encountering a ship in space or at the port can be exciting. The Ship Transponder Info section provides one hundred different ships complete with story hooks. Places is the next section. This section includes casinos and hotels, two hundred unexplored planets, and a ravaged research facility. These tables give the game masters fascinating places to present to their players. The future is a cacophony of clashing media. News and information pour in from tons of sources. The News Chatter section and table provide headlines and news updates. Give your players the sense of a large galaxy with current events happening all around their characters. The Items and Things section contains several tables: from items in a crashed cargo ship to items in a cockpit to items in a captain’s quarters. Players wish to search every room they enter, so be ready with these random tables. Planets full of people will always have something going on. The Events section and table give game masters ways to make the universe feel alive. What event is happening on the planet the player characters just landed on? Roll in the table and find out. Maybe it's a festival, maybe it's a conference. But no matter what it is, it will make the setting come to life. The Names section is quite simple: three hundred human female names, three hundred human male names, and three hundred human surnames. GMs always need names. Players always ask for names. Science fiction characters got to have skills. The Fields of Study section has two tables of engineering fields. These can be used as occupations for non-player characters, skills for player characters, or to add flavor to the setting. The final section is Space. This section contains three tables including spacefaring complications, spatial anomalies, and star system discoveries. Never have a boring trip through hyperspace or a star system where the players find nothing out of the ordinary. These twenty-five random tables are meant to be a game master’s friend. Shake up your campaigns with new ideas and let your players loose. The galaxy awaits and adventure is around every asteroid.

HB Blurb: The one thousand adventures or quests for fantasy tabletop role-playing games in this book add flexibility to the gamemaster’s toolkit. The purpose of this book, just as the first book of quests, is twofold. First, these adventure ideas help gamemasters cut down session prep by providing hooks and situations quickly. Our time is one of the most important resources we have, and we should not be wasting it. Second, these quests are kindling for the gamemaster’s imagination. These ideas are meant to help fan the flames of creativity. The quest ideas in the book are arranged by a broad topic and are placed in D100 random table formats. The ideas can be used in a variety of ways. A gamemaster can roll randomly on a table or select ideas based on their preference. The ideas can be springboards to new campaigns or side quests or storylines that are weaved into an existing campaign. The ideas can be used as-is or mashed together to suit gamemasters’ needs. The tables of ideas are Curses, Deserts, Disasters, Dragons, Dwarves, Fighter Guild, Ghosts, Halflings, Mountains, and War. Each table is developed around a general controlling idea to help gamemasters determine what ideas are appropriate for their campaigns or sessions. Some of the quests are basic concepts and others are more detailed. This was done on purpose to provide a variety of adventure ideas with difficult scopes. It is my sincere hope that this little book inspires thousands of epic quests.
