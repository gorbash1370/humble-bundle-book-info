HB Blurb: Our biggest adventure ever! A Level 5 Adventure for DCC RPGEons past, a brotherhood of mad philosopher-kings marched an army of slaves into the heart of a mountain. On their backs they bore a legendary treasure-hoard: coffers spilling over with blazing gems, strongboxes bright with gold, and the jeweled idols of a thousand gods. They were never seen again.Today the gleaming domes at the top of the world have fallen to the passage of time and the crush of glaciers. Once-imperious halls are coated with dust and ice; memories of the fabled treasure hoard – and the heretical Theophages – are lost to antiquity.
But deep within the heart of the mountain, the flames of Chaos sputter and flare.Now the legacy of the God Eaters is drawing to a close. With each thunderous turn of the Alembic Key, meteors streak the sky and prophets fling themselves from the turrets of high towers. In the alleys and the palaces, all know that the hour of the dragon will soon be at hand.
Can you and your companions master the mysteries of the God Eaters in time? Or – like so many others before – will you succumb to the Music of the Spheres?"

HB Blurb: The DCC RPG Annual was originally conceived as an annual publication that would exist in some form to showcase the brilliance of the DCC RPG community. This would be the DCC RPG Annual, published each year to distribute these gaming creations.The best of things happened: the DCC RPG Annual was never needed. The DCC community burst forth a verdant jungle of inspiration, with ripe fruit on every limb. Blogs and personal posts; zines; community publications; the Gongfarmer’s Almanac; officially licensed third-party works: there is a vast supply of inspiration from whence the DCC judge can draw and iterate.Still, we had a wealth of material that needed a home, so The DCC RPG Annual became a reality.Here’s what you’ll find in this volume:
New Magic
New Quests and Journeys. Explore the lost continent of Mu!
New Judge’s Rules
New Magic Items
New Monsters
And Moustaches. Yes, you read that right—there are rules for moustaches in this book. You know you need it.

Now it falls to a small group of resistance fighters to reclaim freedom for humanity!Inside you will find:
Rules for magic tailored to the post-apocalyptic fantasy setting of the Changeling Earth, including new spells and summonings to enrich any DCC campaign.Character options for adventuring in this world.A discussion of demons, elementals, and monsters, including stats for creatures compatible with any DCC and MCC campaign

Published Date: 
---
HB Blurb: MCC/DCC casting supplement couched in high-technobabble style for your post-apocalyptic, far-future, and dystopian-future campaigns.
The cabalistic and powerful Computarchs built the WorldNet, governed its growth, established its laws and conventions, and seemingly retired from their world-altering creation. They left their tools and programs scattered throughout the vast network. Some have been found by seekers such as yourself and have been passed down from generation to generation. Collectively these pieces of software are known as Enchiridion of the Computarchs.Enchiridion of the Computarchs seeks to give a judge the leg up on developing and using casting mechanics and concepts in high-tech settings. This book encompasses a range of material concerning computers and programs that a “techno-caster” (like the MCC shaman class, or those classes found in Cyber Sprawl Classics, Crawljammer, Umerica, Terror of the Stratosfiend, and Star Crawl Classics) can utilize. You will not only find a collection of spells (aka. programs) in this book but also a new d24 spellburn table, new mechanics for spell failure, and a brief corruption table all couched in a high-technobabble style for your post-apocalyptic, far-future, and dystopian-future campaigns.
