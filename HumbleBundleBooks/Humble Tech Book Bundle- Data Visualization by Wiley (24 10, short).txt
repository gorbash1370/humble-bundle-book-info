HB Blurb: Businesses need to rethink their relationship with technology in order to remain competitive. The transformation to technology is only accelerating and we will never see a pace of change as slow in the future as we have the last few years. As a result, businesses are in a state of "adapt or die". Companies such as Apple and Amazon are leveraging innovative tools and investments to become market leaders. Microsoft and OpenAI have developed new technologies, such as GPT-4, which have generated a lot of public attention. However, the data science field is still jaded due to past false starts. To unlock the value trapped in data, businesses need to form a partnership between the executive level, strategists, and technical experts, and develop a new top-level technology model. With the new user-technology relationship paradigm, businesses are handing over more autonomy to models for intelligent processes. This book explains how to go from a legacy business to a competitive and profitable business using data and AI. It covers the three pillars of success for data and AI initiatives: frameworks, roadmaps, and technical implementations. To be successful, businesses must align their teams, strategies, and technology, and develop the necessary roles, such as data product managers and data strategists.

HB Blurb: The first edition of Data Smart showed how data science doesnt always need Big Data solutions to understand and work with data. When the book came out, the world was still wrestling with how to define Big Data. Today, much of the corporate world has moved beyond understanding data problems through the Big Data lens. However, the same data problems remain. Many people do not fully understand whats happening beneath the algorithms. And they are often mislead into thinking a larger, technology-focused solution will beat what can be done in a simple spreadsheet.Perhaps the single most important distinction in this update will be to show off Excels data science applications. Since the era of the first edition, Microsoft has put in significant effort to place Excel into the data science process. The aim of this update is to also show how Excel can fit into the data science ecosystem using many of its new features while also not competing but rather complementing more dynamic tools, while also attending to data visualization principles as a means of communicating results.  Ultimately, the world still struggles using data the way it did when the first edition came out. While Big Data might be on the way out, its been replaced by an obsession with Artificial Intelligence. But AI isnt easy to implement, and many people still dont understand data science fundamentals. This updated edition will use Excels new features to explain data science (still in a conversational way), introducing readers to complex topics using just Excel as well as introduce readers to AI topics. It will also focus on the top data science problems experienced by todays analysts. Finally, the content of this book will be updated for Windows audiences which reflects the most popular version of the tool.

HB Blurb: There used to be a time when a companys IT team would manage all of the data and create the necessary charts and reports from that data, based on the users needs. But now, for most companies, those days are long gone!  In todays world, we are all overwhelmed by huge amounts of data from many different sources. And on top of that, our co-workers, bosses, vendors, and customers are asking us for all kinds of reports and charts from that data. They also want it to be flexible, so they can change the parameters, and have it produce instant results. Oh, and by the way, they needed it all yesterday! Sort it this way, filter it this way, show it month by month, etc. It is a daunting and time-consuming task, to say the least! Plus, you have all of the other responsibilities for your job as well.  Microsoft Excel has great tools to help you manage your data, and report on it the way you need to. Using Pivot Tables, PowerQuery, PowerPivot, you can pull in data from many sources, clean up and prepare your data, summarize your data in many ways, add to your data with formulas, create visually appealing and interactive dashboards and get real results from your data, all without having to be a programmer. This book will show how to use these tools in an easy-to-follow step by step format, backed up with screen prints and real-life examples.  Pivot Tables, the PowerQuery, and the PowerPivot are very powerful tools, and they can do a lot of different things. They are very popular in the marketplace. But people do not really know how to use them properly and are even intimated by them. There are videos and books that will show people how to use them, but many times the people who make the videos and books talk too technically or with too much jargon, so that these resources are not that helpful for most people out there.  The marketplace needs an easy-to-use guide that will allow them to get quick, meaningful results from their data, without having a degree in computing.

HB Blurb: Avoiding Data Pitfalls is a useful resource that points out common data viz. mistakes so that users can avoid making them and notice them when they are made by others. Working with data is so common now, but the vast majority of data workers were trained in another technical field like engineering or science. Most were not explicitly taught how to successfully work with todays tools and the types of data at their disposal. This book will provide illustrative examples of common mistakes, first outlining how we often think about data and the "data-reality gap," before walking the reader through each step of successful data visualization, from calculating and analyzing data to eventually presenting it in a way that is both clear and effective. The author will detail common data viz. blunders like cluttered design and ineffective use of color so that the reader can differentiate between a poor presentation and something truly representative and useful.

HB Blurb: MakeoverMonday seeks to highlight and celebrate creative approaches to data visualization. Based on the authors' #MakeoverMonday project, where members of the data visualization community edited and reworked existing ineffective charts, this book features hundreds of less-than-stellar charts which the authors provide multiple alternatives for.A reader will flip through this book for inspiration. They might browse randomly and consider a few makeovers from a particular dataset. Doing this, they can compare different approaches to a similar dataset. By having makeovers next to each other, the impact of differences in formatting, layout, colour, font, chart type can be seen. Readers can pick up valuable insights into visualizing different data collections just by thumbing through the pages. The example datasets range from the serious (police violence) to the fun (changes in the cosmetics industry). There is no other book which takes one dataset and presents so many different perspectives on the same data.

HB Blurb: Learn and provide clear insights into how to structure and lead a successful analytics team. This is a deceptively challenging goal since there are no templates to work from. Establishing a project management office, information services, or human resources department is an understood process and does not vary greatly between organizations. Establishing an analytics team, by contrast, requires a significant up-front investment in understanding and contextualizing the initiative. Many organizations have attempted to use operating models and templates from other functions, in particular IT and operations research. This fundamental misunderstanding of where analytics fits within an organization has led to visible failures and has set back the analytical maturity of many organizations. Business leaders need to hire or develop data-centric talent who are able to step back from analysis and project management to view their work through a lens of value-creation. Understand how organizations and practitioners need to structure, build, and lead a successful analytics team - to bridge the gap between business leaders and the analytical function. The analytics job market is very frothy, and the talent pool has swelled in recent years with engineers, actuaries, and scientists up-skilling and re-branding themselves as data scientists. This influx of highly technical specialists with limited leadership experience has had negative consequences for the practice as a whole. Minding the Machines is organized in three key pillars: Strategy, Process, and People. Strategy - How to assess organizational readiness, identify gaps, establish an attainable roadmap, and properly articulate a value proposition and case for change. Process - How to select and manage projects across their lifecycle including design thinking, risk assessment, governance, and operationalization. People - How to structure and engage a team, establish productive and parsimonious conventions, and to lead a distinct practice with unique requirements. Analytical practitioners want to read this book because career progression opportunities for analytical professionals are very limited. Despite reaching senior technical roles they often report to a business focused manager who understands little about the analytical function. Practitioners seek leadership opportunities, but do not have the tools to move into leadership roles or to be successful in them. Business leaders with foundational analytical abilities want to read this book because what they may have learned from other business units is at best not applicable to analytics teams, and at worst counterproductive. There needs to be a resource specific to this unique practice. Students want to read this book because though they are developing strong technical abilities and learning the newest techniques, they are not being instructed in business leadership in an analytics context. This gap in education is amplifying the problem as the profession moves away from long-horizon highly technical solutions and towards a focus on immediate value.

HB Blurb: Data has enjoyed the bystander status in attempts to digitize responsibility and morality in tech, but data units actually carries this discrimination. By deconstructing it into its social, political, economical, racial, gendered ingredients, we can build up ways to curb oppressive practices prior to, during and after digital entry. This book is for the rebel tech talent, those who acknowledge and are ready to address the limitations of software development. They recognize that techs philosophy and practice of move fast break things is inherently problematic, needs to be changed and want to pinpoint the ways discrimination exists in this digital data space. The primary reader for the bookis a junior-level software developer who has worked on least two significant software development projects. Intermediate language concepts of classes, objects, abstraction, encapsulation, and polymorphism from any C-family language such as C, Python, or JavaScript. Fundamental algorithmic design techniques associated with sorting, searching, and graph algorithms. Core relational database system design concepts of entity-relationship modeling, SQL querying using aggregate functions and joins, and data normalization.
