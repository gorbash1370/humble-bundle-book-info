HB Blurb: The success of any software application or system depends on the architecture style you use. This updated report presents several common architecture styles to guide designers and developers on how to design components and to help you determine the ways in which those components should interact. Author Mark Richards takes a deep dive into many common software architecture styles. Each chapter includes a full explanation of how a particular style works, outlines its benefits and considerations, and describes the circumstances and conditions the style was designed to address. This report also presents an analysis of and scorecard for each style based on several architecture and software development quality attributes.Architecture styles include:Layered architecture Microkernel architecture Event-driven architecture Microservices architecture Space-based architecture This second edition includes new techniques and advances that have appeared for each architecture style over the past seven years. Guidelines in each chapter also reveal when--and when not--to use the style described. This edition introduces new topics such as the difference between architecture patterns and styles, monolithic versus distributed architectures, and technical versus domain partitioning.About the author:Mark Richards is a software architect with significant experience and expertise in application, integration, and enterprise architecture. Active in the software industry since 1983, he's the author of several O'Reilly books and videos, including Software Architecture: The Hard Parts, Software Architecture Fundamentals, Enterprise Messaging, Java Message Service, second edition, and 97 Things Every Software Architect Should Know.

HB Blurb: There are no easy decisions in software architecture. Instead, there are many hard parts--difficult problems or issues with no best practices--that force you to choose among various compromises. With this book, you'll learn how to think critically about the trade-offs involved with distributed architectures.Architecture veterans and practicing consultants Neal Ford, Mark Richards, Pramod Sadalage, and Zhamak Dehghani discuss strategies for choosing an appropriate architecture. By interweaving a story about a fictional group of technology professionals--the Sysops Squad--they examine everything from how to determine service granularity, manage workflows and orchestration, manage and decouple contracts, and manage distributed transactions to how to optimize operational characteristics, such as scalability, elasticity, and performance. By focusing on commonly asked questions, this book provides techniques to help you discover and weigh the trade-offs as you confront the issues you face as an architect. Analyze trade-offs and effectively document your decisionsMake better decisions regarding service granularityUnderstand the complexities of breaking apart monolithic applicationsManage and decouple contracts between servicesHandle data in a highly distributed architectureLearn patterns to manage workflow and transactions when breaking apart applications
