HB Blurb: The final book in the CEREBUS saga and the conclusion to comics' first 6,000-page graphic novel! Follow Cerebus' last day on Earth as he deals with debilitating aches and pains, memory loss, political turmoil, indigestion, and incontinence in a world he no longer understands, while waiting for his son to come visit and hopefully fix everything! All this and the Meaning of Life and Existence in issues 289/290! It’s the finish of a series which pushed  the versatility and uniqueness of the comics medium in ways never seen before, from writing and pacing, to illustrating and lettering to publishing, and opened the door for other self-publishers while inspiring a multitude of comic-book artists!

Book 02:
Title: Latter Days
Author(s): Dave Sim & Gerhard

ISBN-10: 9780919359222 - ISBN-13: 0919359221 - ASIN: 
Published Date: 2003

HB Blurb: The penultimate book in the CEREBUS saga! Cerebus finds he has to start over from square one, deciding to try his hand first as a shepherd, then as Estarcion’s second greatest five-bar-gate athlete, before finally becoming the proprietor of a ‘gentleman’s club’ in the heart of Cirinist territory. However, it seems fate has other plans for the aardvark in the form of the Three Wise Fellows, who kidnap him, and set him on the path towards fulfilling his destiny and finally ridding Estarcion of the Cirinists! Contains the Todd McFarlane and Spawn parody Todd McSpahn, Spore, and his amazing Spore-Wagon, and the Garth Ennis Preacher parody, Rabbi! The later half of the book involves Cerebus’ in-depth examination and interpretation of the Torah, delivered to him by Konigsberg, the not-so-good Samaritan (a parody of Woody Allen).
--------------------------------------------------

Book 03:
Title: Form & Void
Author(s): Dave Sim & Gerhard

Published Date: 
---
HB Blurb: As Cerebus and Jaka continue to Sand Hills Creek, they meet Cerebus’ hero, Ham Ernestway (based on Ernest Hemingway), and his wife Mary, who decide to accompany the couple on their journey. As trouble develops in Cerebus and Jaka’s relationship, Mary Ernestway takes it upon herself to try and fix things by telling a story based on the Hemingways’ actual trip to Africa. Let’s just say the end results are less than ideal, leading to a life or death situation as Cerebus and Jaka find themselves trapped on the side of a mountain in a snowstorm, with quickly dwindling supplies and no hope of escape!
--------------------------------------------------

Book 04:
Title: Going Home
Author(s): Dave Sim & Gerhard
---
ISBN-10:  - ISBN-13:  - ASIN: 0919359191
Published Date: 
---
HB Blurb: Leaving the bar behind, Cerebus and Jaka reunite and travel across Cirnist-conquered Estarcion, gradually attempting to make their way to Cerebus’ childhood home of Sand Hills Creek while various political and social factions keep a close eye on the pair for their own reasons. With guest appearances by Alan Moore and Rick Veitch, the latter half of the book also introduces the F. Scott Fitzgerld parody, F Stop. Kennedy, who has his own purpose for wanting to stick close to the couple (especially the Princess of Palnu), as they travel along the Feld River under close Cirinist watch and guard.
--------------------------------------------------

Book 05:
Title: Rick's Story
Author(s): Dave Sim & Gerhard
---
ISBN-10: None - ISBN-13: OCLC:700950366 - ASIN: 0919359183
Published Date: 1998
---
HB Blurb: Having gained a level of maturity after the last book and now in charge of running the bar (that’s right! It’s Cerebus the Bartender!), Cerebus must contend with Jaka’s ex-husband Rick, now an aspiring writer, who returns to make the aardvark’s life a living hell. Considerably different from when they last met, Rick latches onto Cerebus and the tavern, working on his book while trying to conceal what’s really going on inside of him and the depths of his psychological damage. Meanwhile, Cerebus must deal with the repercussions of his relationship with Joanne from the previous book, while trying to decide how best to handle Rick and his hero-worship (which transforms into something much more, with a lasting effect on Cerebus for the remainder of the series).
--------------------------------------------------

Book 06:
Title: Guys
Author(s): Dave Sim & Gerhard
---
ISBN-10: 9781404655324 - ISBN-13: 1404655328 - ASIN: 0919359175
Published Date: 1997
---
HB Blurb: Cerebus returns to Estarcion and takes up residence in a bar where alcohol is free and there’s no last call! Confined to a tiny tavern with other unmarried men (including his best friend Bear), Cerebus tries to make sense of all he has learned, (mostly by getting drunk from morning to night and acting exactly how you’d expect), while learning what it means to be a male living in a Cirnist dominated world. Featuring a cast of characters including self-published comic-book characters, this book also contains parodies of the Beatles, The Rolling Stones, and Margaret Thatcher. It’s a humorous examination of drinking, male and female relationships, and growing maturity, with the underlying words of advice: “Never fall in love with a bar!”
--------------------------------------------------

Book 07:
Title: Minds
Author(s): Dave Sim & Gerhard
---
ISBN-10: None - ISBN-13: OCLC:1036697425 - ASIN: 0919359167
Published Date: 1998
---
HB Blurb: This is it! The conclusion to the MOTHERS & DAUGHTERS storyline, and in many ways the majority of the series to this point! After the bloodbath of the last book, Cerebus and Cirin square off as they hurtle through space on a tiny piece of the rock, passing through and experiencing the various Spheres of the Gods, towards a (possible) meeting with the creator of the universe! It’s further shock and surprise, as the fourth book in the MOTHERS & DAUGHTERS storyline provides a capstone to the previous four thousand pages, and Cerebus learns his true destiny and the meaning of his life up to this point!
--------------------------------------------------

Book 08:
Title: Reads
Author(s): Dave Sim & Gerhard
---
ISBN-10: 9780919359154 - ISBN-13: 0919359159 - ASIN: 
Published Date: 1986
---
HB Blurb: The third book in the MOTHERS & DAUGHTERS storyline! Meet Victor Reid and Viktor Davis (two figures with an important connection to Cerebus and his world), as Cerebus, Astoria, Suenteus Po, and Cirin converge in the Papal Throne of the Eastern Church to determine who will become the ultimate ruler of Iest! With shocking secrets about the four of them and the world around them finally revealed, this book contains one of the longest and bloodiest fight scenes in the whole series (and perhaps in comics), while analyzing the relationship between artist and audience in a unique and new way..
--------------------------------------------------

Book 09:
Title: Women
Author(s): Dave Sim & Gerhard
---
ISBN-10: 9780919359147 - ISBN-13: 0919359140 - ASIN: 
Published Date: 1994
---
HB Blurb: It’s the second book in the four part MOTHERS & DAUGHTERS storyline! As Cerebus returns from the Eighth Sphere, Astoria (leader of the Daughter-centered Kevillist movement) and Cirin (leader of the Mother-centered Cirinist movement) contend for political and social dominance in Cirinist controlled Iest, while rebellions and pockets of mysterious occurrences continue to break out all around them (which may or may not be connected to Cerebus). Meanwhile, Cirin attempts to undertake her own Ascension. Including the critically acclaimed (even by Neil Gaiman!) Sandman parody, with Swoon and Snuff!
--------------------------------------------------

Book 10:
Title: Flight
Author(s): Dave Sim & Gerhard
---
ISBN-10: 9780919359130 - ISBN-13: 0919359132 - ASIN: B002361ZZS
Published Date: 1993
---
HB Blurb: The second half of the CEREBUS storyline explodes into action with the seventh book in the series! Hunted and attacked by the Cirinist army all around him, Cerebus fights back, armed with only his sword and Missy by his side! Meanwhile, strange appearances and disappearances begin taking place throughout Estarcion as Cirin proceeds with her plans for the Final Ascension. Bringing back almost every CEREBUS character in the series, (including the first visual appearance of Suenteus Po, and the Punisher parody, Punisherroach), the first book in the four part MOTHERS & DAUGHTERS storyline picks up many of the unresolved threads from the first half of the series.
--------------------------------------------------

Book 11:
Title: Melmoth
Author(s): Dave Sim & Gerhard
---
ISBN-10: None - ISBN-13: UOM:39015058767644 - ASIN: 0919359108
Published Date: 1991
---
HB Blurb: Believing he has lost Jaka forever, Cerebus takes up residence at Dino’s Cafe, a shell of his former self and completely disconnected from the world, while the Cirinst takeover proceeds in full swing all around him. Unable to get even a menu from a waitress, this looks like it might be the end of the line for the earth-pig born! Against this backdrop is a faithful retelling of the final days of Oscar Wilde. Also includes appearances by Normalroach and various other cast members. It’s a story about loss and death depicted in a way only possible in the comics medium!
--------------------------------------------------

Book 12:
Title: Jaka's Story
Author(s): Dave Sim & Gerhard
---
ISBN-10: None - ISBN-13: UOM:39015058767800 - ASIN: 0919359124
Published Date: 1990
---
HB Blurb: After the climax of the previous storyline, Cerebus returns to Iest to find his life in ruins and becomes the houseguest of the love of his life, Jaka, (and her husband Rick) while living under the fascist regime of the Matriarchal Cirinsits. That’s right! It’s Cerebus the Houseguest! Within the confines of a tiny cast, this novel addresses the themes of love, relationships and marriages, while also a commentary on art, artists, and censorship, and introduces portrayals of Oscar Wilde and Margaret Thatcher.
--------------------------------------------------

Book 13:
Title: Church & State II
Author(s): Dave Sim & Gerhard
---
ISBN-10: None - ISBN-13: UOM:39015058767503 - ASIN: 0919359116
Published Date: 1988
---
HB Blurb: Part two of the CHURCH & STATE STORYLINE! Cerebus fights back to reclaim all that he has lost, while contending against forces beyond his control as he’s swept into the battle for The Final Ascension. Who will be the chosen one to finally meet Tarim (the creator of the entire universe), and what happens when they actually do? Find out in the concluding book of one of comics’ longest running storylines! Including parodies of Frank MIller’s The Dark Knight Returns, Marvel’s Secret Wars, Alan Moore’s Swamp Thing, The Rolling Stones, and more!
--------------------------------------------------

Book 14:
Title: Church & State I
Author(s): Dave Sim & Gerhard
---
ISBN-10: None - ISBN-13: UOM:39015058767503 - ASIN: 0919359094
Published Date: 1988
---
HB Blurb: Cerebus gets caught up in the war between the Eastern and Western Churches, as the various factions attempt to use him as a pawn in their machinations with DISASTROUS results. A satire and commentary on faith and power, this volume includes many of the popular characters in the series (including the Wolverine parody, Wolverroach), and brings background artist Gerhard on board, who would help define the expertly crafted and technically proficient visual style and environments the series is known for.
--------------------------------------------------

Book 15:
Title: High Society
Author(s): Dave Sim
---
ISBN-10: 9781626280298 - ISBN-13: 1626280290 - ASIN: 0919359078
Published Date: 2021-02
---
HB Blurb: Cerebus travels to the City-State of Iest and gets pulled into the world of high-power politics, finding himself running  for Prime Minister. His political opponent? A Goat! It’s a high stakes campaign in the Goat vs. Aardvark election for control of the City-State of Iest, culminating in one of the most suspenseful elections in the history of comics. With parodies of Bill Sienkiewicz’s Moon Knight, the Marx Brothers, Monty Python, and more thrown in for good measure in this highly acclaimed political satire (looking less like satire and more like a documentary every day)!
--------------------------------------------------

Book 16:
Title: Cerebus
Author(s): Dave Sim
---
ISBN-10: 9781613776735 - ISBN-13: 161377673X - ASIN: 0919359086
Published Date: 2015-12-15
---
HB Blurb: The saga starts here! Beginning as a parody of Conan starring a barbarian aardvark, CEREBUS quickly grew into much more, helping pave the way for self-published comics and becoming one of the longest running self-published comic-books in the history of the medium. This first volume introduces Cerebus the Aardvark as he travels across the land of Estarcion in search of fortune and power, and introduces many of the characters who play pivotal roles later in the series, including Jaka, Elrod, The Roach (later appearing as the Captain America parody, Captain Cockroach), Lord Julius, and many more!
