One such discovery has the potential to turn the world upside down—a complex mathematical for- mula that, when applied correctly, can predict what a subject will do given any set of situational parameters. The scientist who made the discovery is now poised to be counted among the most brilliant minds in the Crescent Empire and perhaps beyond. But some do not want such powerful knowledge to spread, and wish to claim the formula for themselves. They have threatened the scientist with the worst fate that can befall an Imperial citizen—familial dishonor, courtesy of the uncouth behaviors of the scientist’s troubled young ward. Unraveling the tensions in the family and stopping these blackmailers from getting hold of the formula is a task fit for Heroes...

In the small village of Tanaford the inhabitants live in fear of a being that has become known as Ashes. Whispers of this Sidhe’s powers and deeds have spread to neighboring communities, becoming woven into the tales told around the evenings fire, but no one from the village itself gives a straight answer. They give no comment on friends or family who are missing or the burned shells of family homes; meanwhile, their harvest looks set to be the most bountiful for years, and their livestock has not been affected by the recent murrain which has plagued the neighboring villages.

HB Blurb: Nikandros, professional scoundrel and scourge of the commonfolk, has surfaced after an absence with a strange Syrneth artifact–a lyre with seven strings of water instead of animal gut. Kept secret, no one knows what the so-dubbed water lyre does or just how powerful it is. Terrible rumors swirl, but a chance to settle them has arrived. Nikandros is hosting a gala at his estate in Montaigne where he will auction off the water lyre. Most people know they should be wary, but curiosity besting caution guest after guest. Nikandros hoards his trophies, he doesn’t sell them. For some reason, though, the water lyre is different. Some say the water lyre’s only magic is in its strings, but others claim it can sway minds when played. No one saving a missing archeologist has studied the lyre up close, so no one is certain. The potential power and harm are certainly great and, in the wrong hands, catastrophic. An exciting and vast adventure that involves intrigue, espionage, bribery and adventure!

Published Date:

HB Blurb: You want a Colonies adventure? Here’s a Colonies adventure! The Council of Six Hearts is a robust organization for keeping the peace in Iaka:Et’serra, but it also means six nations must be in alignment before anything is agreed upon, a process that can take weeks or even months if a conclusion is even reached at all. While most respect the Council’s careful methods of deliberation and debate, others chafe under what seems like their needlessly plodding methods. Especially as two nations, the ascetic Ah-nah-see and the opportunistic Dee-ah-noh-see-nah, collide over territory and control over the lucrative fur trade. With Vesten raiders and the native peoples of Iaka:Et’serra currently maintaining a fragile peace, an ambitious Dee-ah-noh-see-nah diplomat has arranged for a diplomatic meeting with Ah-nah-see representatives at a remote neutral lodge. Unfortunately, he’s been detained by the Vesten while en route, and without him things could rapidly spiral out of control. Fort Utterstrom is a powerful Vesten stronghold, so a frontal assault is out of the question, especially if peace is to be maintained. But if some resourceful Heroes were to let themselves be captured, they might be able to break out and rescue the diplomat in time to save the day…

Author(s): John Wick

ISBN-10:  - ISBN-13:  - ASIN: 
Published Date: 
---
HB Blurb: In the postscript of his novel, The Name of the Rose, Umberto Eco suggests the greatest mystery novel would end with the reader discovering that he was the murderer. As soon as I read that, I said to myself, “That can only happen in a roleplaying game.” And thus, this adventure. Who Killed Lord Wójcik? is a murder mystery that exploits the unique technology of roleplaying games in a way that novels, movies, and TV shows cannot. It includes a handful of possible assassins and GM Advice.

ISBN-10:  - ISBN-13:  - ASIN: 1987916743
Published Date:

HB Blurb: Welcome to Five Sails is a short introductory adventure for playing in the city of Five Sails. It brings your players into the city, introduces them to some of its local color and flavor, then puts something they care about in immediate danger. You can play Welcome to Five Sails with up to 4-5 players, although I suggest no more than that. Your players should take only one or two sessions to complete the adventure. It includes a fast-paced adventure in Théah’s most interesting city, scads of NPCs to meet, player handouts, and GM advice.

HB Blurb: The horrors of Eisen are a well-known threat to those who must travel the perilous countryside, and they endanger the innocent and guilty alike. When people think of these horrors, they typically think of supernatural perversions of nature—the undead, the cursed and the products of dark sorceries. But humanity is also just as capable of visiting horror on itself, and one terrifying example of this now rampages across the land—a soldier made of gears and steel, animated by no known force, pursuing its purpose with deadly efficiency and absolute focus. Unfortunately for those around it, that purpose seems to include killing as many people as possible. It has left many dead already, and appears to be unstoppable. But it has not met a Hero yet...
