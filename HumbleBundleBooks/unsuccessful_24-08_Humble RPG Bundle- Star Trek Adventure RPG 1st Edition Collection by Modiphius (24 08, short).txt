HB Blurb: “Are you pretending to do a “Captains Log?”A routine maintenance overhaul on a subspace relay station identifies a much bigger problem on a nearby planet. Starfleet data leaking from the relay station is being used as entertainment by a pre-warp civilization and only junior officers can fix a problem that (yet again!) endangers the Prime Directive.Starfleet has given your crew instructions to perform a long-overdue maintenance overhaul on Subspace Relay Station 2103. The situation becomes complicated (of course it does) when the maintenance team discovers that a malfunction has caused the transmission of classified signals that could have been intercepted by the cultures of a nearby planet.Shawan II is home to a pre-warp humanoid civilization at a late 20th-century Earth level that appears to have made a pop-culture phenomenon out of the potentially classified Starfleet data (great idea, wish I’d thought of it). The crew of your ship must ensure that the leaked data doesn’t compromise Starfleet in any way. Someone’s going to have to go down to the planet but the senior crew could be recognised by fans of the Starfleet transmissions. So it falls to some intrepid and ingenious ensigns to sneak onto the planet, engage with fans and critics at a convention, and sort this mess out (what could possibly go wrong??).Although this is a standalone adventure, a one-page mission brief provides inspiration for continuing the mission.This 21-page PDF adventure for the Star Trek Adventures roleplaying game is written by Christopher L. Bennett, and is set in the Lower Decks era with the player characters being the junior officers of a Starfleet vessel. This adventure also contains advice on adaptation for use in campaigns based in other Star Trek eras and/or senior members of the crew.This product requires a Star Trek Adventures core rulebook to use. This is a PDF product; upon purchase you will be emailed a link to access it. There is no print version of this product.
