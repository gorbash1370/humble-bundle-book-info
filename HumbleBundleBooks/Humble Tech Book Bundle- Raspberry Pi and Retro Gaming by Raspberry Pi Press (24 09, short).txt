HB Blurb: Take inspiration from the golden age of video games and learn how to write your own modern classicsCode the Classics Volume 1 not only tells the stories of some of the seminal video games of the 1970s and 1980s, but shows you how to create your own games inspired by them, following examples programmed by Raspberry Pi founder Eben Upton. In this book, you'll learn how to run and edit the games in this book by installing Python, Pygame Zero, and an IDE. You'll also:Get game design tips and tricks from the mastersLearn how to code your own games with Pygame ZeroExplore the code listings and find out how they workYou'll meet these vintage-inspired games, and learn from their code in between rounds of play:Boing!: all it took was a couple of lines and a dot, and gamers would be queuing up to play.Cavern: Enduringly popular, the platform game genre is still packed with creative possibilities.Infinite Bunner: Play around with the benefits that a top-down perspective can lend to the classic platform genre.Myriapod: Some shooters confine the gameplay to a single screen while limiting the player's movement. Restrictions can build challenge and difficulty, making for truly addictive gaming.Substitute Soccer: Top-down games of pinball-style soccer built a huge cult following and kicked off a sports genre that's still going strong.

HB Blurb: The 1980s and 1990s were a glorious era for gaming! In just twelve short years (1982-1994) we had the Sinclair Spectrum, Commodore 64, Amiga, and Atari ST; NES, SNES, Sega Master System, Sega Genesis/Mega Drive, and Saturn right up to the Sony PlayStation. The pace of change from bitmapped graphics, through to sprite scaling and eventually 3D polygon graphics was breathtaking. We're still nursing sore thumbs from endless button-bashing.This book shows you, step-by-step, how to turn Raspberry Pi into several classic consoles and computers. Discover where to get brand new games from, and even how to start coding games. If you're brave, we'll show you how to build a full-sized arcade machine.This book will help you to:Write a classic text adventureCreate a Pong-style video gameEmulate classic computers and consoles on Raspberry Pi or Raspberry Pi PicoCreate authentic-looking replicas of classic machines right down to their casesDiscover controllers and other retro gaming hardware to enhance your experiencesConnect Raspberry Pi to a cathode-ray tube (CRT) displayRediscovering retro games is a fantastic hobby. You get all the thrill of nostalgia, and replay classic games that still hold up today, and you learn how computers and consoles work in the process.

HB Blurb: Design and make your own microcontroller board using the same chip that powers the popular Raspberry Pi PicoKiCad is an amazing piece of free and open-source software that allows anyone, with some time and effort, to make high-quality PCB designs. Couple this amazing software with numerous PCB fabrication companies and even PCBA services (companies that will make and assemble your PCB designs) and there's never been a better time to get into this aspect of making.This book provides a gentle introduction to PCB design using the RP2040 microcontroller chip (the same chip that's at the heart of the Raspberry Pi Pico). You'll learn how to create a schematic for a microcontroller board using the RP2040, from assigning schematic symbols to creating a footprint for individual components. You'll quickly move on to laying out the PCB design and preparing it for manufacture!That's right--after your board is designed, this book will show you how to send it off to be manufactured and assembled. You'll find out about the various materials (or substrates) you can choose for your board, and learn how to pick the right manufacturer. Once you have your board in hand, you'll also learn what you can do (and make!) with it, and there will be plenty of ideas for expansions, such as motor drivers.

HB Blurb: Microcontrollers, like the RP2040 chip at the heart of Raspberry Pi Pico, are computers stripped back to their bare essentials. You don't use monitors or keyboards with them — instead, you program them over USB to take their input from (and send their output to) on-board input/output pins.Using these programmable connections, you can light LEDs, make noises, send text to screens, and much more. In Get started with MicroPython on Raspberry Pi Pico 2nd Edition, you will learn how to use the beginner-friendly MicroPython language to write programs, and you’ll connect up hardware to make your Raspberry Pi Pico interact with the world around it. Using these skills, you can create your own electromechanical projects, whether for fun or to make your life easier.Fully updated for Raspberry Pi Pico W and the latest version of MicroPython, this book shows you how to:Get started with Raspberry Pi Pico and Pico WWork with various electronic componentsCreate your own programmable electronic contraptionsTurn Raspberry Pi Pico W into a network-connected node for the Internet of ThingsLink your Pico W to your smartphone, tablet, or another Pico W with Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)Whether you’re using Raspberry Pi Pico for a home project, industrial automation, or learning (or teaching!) electronics and programming, this book will show you how.Chapter 1: Get to know your Raspberry Pi PicoChapter 2: Programming with MicroPythonChapter 3: Physical computingChapter 4: Physical computing with Raspberry Pi PicoChapter 5: Traffic light controllerChapter 6: Reaction gameChapter 7: Burglar alarmChapter 8: Temperature gaugeChapter 9: Data loggerChapter 10: Digital communication protocols: I2C and SPIChapter 11: Wi-Fi connectivity with Pico WChapter 12: Bluetooth connectivity with Pico WAppendix A: Raspberry Pi Pico specificationsAppendix B: Pinout guideAppendix C: Programmable I/O

HB Blurb: The home computer boom of the 1980s brought with it now-iconic machines such as the ZX Spectrum, BBC Micro, and Commodore 64. Those machines would inspire a generation and foster the creation of a booming British software industry that continues to this day.With the help of hefty government discounts, computers worked their way into primary and secondary schools around the country. Millions more computers appeared in living rooms and bedrooms around the country. For once, Britain was ahead of the world, helping to create a golden generation of British programmers.The Computers That Made Britain tells the story of 19 of those computers, and what happened behind the scenes. This book is as much a story about each computer's creation as it is about the people that created them.Through dozens of interviews with the people who were there, discover the tales of missed deadlines, technical faults, business interference, and the unheralded geniuses who brought to the UK everything from the Dragon 32 and ZX81, to the Amstrad CPC 464 and Commodore Amiga. This book closes with the story of the Acorn Archimedes, which introduced the revolutionary ARM processor that powers smart watches, laptops, routers, mobile phones, and the Raspberry Pi to this day.
