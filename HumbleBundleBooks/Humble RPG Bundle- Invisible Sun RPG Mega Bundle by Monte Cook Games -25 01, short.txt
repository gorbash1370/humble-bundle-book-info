Book 01:
Title: Invisible Sun
Author(s): Monte Cook
---
ISBN-10:  - ISBN-13:  - ASIN: 1950568040
Published Date: 
---
HB Blurb: The legendary Invisible Sun is an amazing and visionary tabletop roleplaying game that introduces a truly unique and original setting and new modes of RPG play, along with gameplay focused on amazingly rich characters and complex, rewarding campaign plotlines. Described as “brilliant and revolutionary” by the LA Review of Books and “immensely fascinating” by Forbes, Game Informer says “it’s hard to overstate the originality of setting and tone of the game.” If you’re looking for a rich and vibrant TTRPG experience that will take your imagination to places you’ve never been, the legendary Invisible Sun is the key to your jouney.This world you see around you is Shadow—a world illuminated only by the Grey Sun. You think it is your home, but that’s because you have forgotten your true self. Awaken, and return to the Actuality and to Satyrine, the city under the Indigo Sun. You are a vislae, a wielder of magic; a shaper of reality; a student of secrets and the real truths that lay hidden within the Actuality. You sought shelter in Shadow to escape the war, but the war is now over and your home has called you back.The Actuality seems like a surreal dream to those of us toiling aimlessly in the boring, grey realm you and I falsely believe is the real world. Invisible Sun characters face incredible challenges, visit breathtaking places, and discover secrets so astonishing that the only ones who can cope with them are those who understand the truth that powers the universe: Magic.Invisible Sun characters are richly realized, and the game encourages stories that engage them through intertwining plotlines. The setting is nuanced, detailed, vivid, and truly unlike anything previously brought to RPGs. The product itself is equally astonishing, bringing the world and the game experience to life through four books totaling 600 pages; over a thousand spells and related effects; dozens of handouts and player-facing documents; a campaign notebook for the GM; and much, much more.

Book 02:
Title: Secrets of Silent Streets
Author(s): Monte Cook
---
ISBN-10:  - ISBN-13:  - ASIN: 
Published Date: 
---
HB Blurb: The City of Notions. The Heart of Indigo. The Center of the Real World. Like any metropolis in any realm, Satyrine isn’t one city but many. Even a vislae can’t know the entirety of it, no matter how many lives they live there. Fartown, the Marquis Quarter, the Strangeglass District, the Hollows, and the vast abandoned stretches—all offer different experiences and moods as well as unique landmarks, resources, denizens, and dangers. Satyrine is something different to every citizen and visitor who explores her streets.Secrets of Silent Streets is a guide to this vast, rich, and unique city—the epicenter of the orders of magic and, to many, the very center of the Actuality. Visit the Great Observatory of Zuin, where mystical astronomers equate the movement of the stars with the ebbs and flows of magic. Meet the Phalanx of Liquid Granite, who have turned absurdity magic into a martial art. Enter the Citrine Court, a secret conclave of vislae devoted to transforming themselves—physically and metaphorically—into famous novels from Shadow.These are just a few of the experiences you’ll discover as you travel the seventeen districts of Satyrine and beyond, each detailed through dozens of points of interest and illuminated through its own unique atmosphere, social expectations, and traditions. Along the way you’ll find scores of plot hooks, NPCs, creatures—and of course plenty of magic.

Book 03:
Title: Teratology
Author(s): Bruce Cordell, Monte Cook, Shanna Germain

ISBN-10:  - ISBN-13:  - ASIN: No ASIN found
Published Date: 
---
HB Blurb: When asked how many beings live in the Actuality, the famed trailblazer Taramoc Eslin answered with characteristic aplomb: “All of them.” No book could possibly catalog every creature everywhere, but her masterwork is the most comprehensive volume to date; the greatest resource on the creatures of the Actuality ever attempted by any vislae. Not just another bestiary, but the bestiary. The Teratology.Behind the cover of this 192-page volume, wise vislae, you will find new insights into the realms beneath each sun, including newly discovered (or at least newly chronicled) locations. And you’ll find hundreds of creatures, spirits, and other entities that inhabit those realms, painstakingly researched and described. You will even meet important and distinctive personalities who walk the Path of Suns.Any vislae venturing from Indigo will find this tome an indispensible resource. Goetics in particular will prize its trove of daringly-acquired insights into summonable beings. And even those who remain within Satyrine will discover many creatures they had not even imagined could be found so close.

Book 04:
Title: The Threshold
Author(s): Monte Cook
---
ISBN-10:  - ISBN-13:  - ASIN: No ASIN found
Published Date: 
---
HB Blurb: What lies beyond the Actuality? What lies beyond the pinnacle of a vislae’s power? The vislae’s road has many steps. Shadow. Satyrine. The Path of Suns and the worlds of the Actuality. At each step the vislae’s eyes and mind are further opened. But are there even greater mysteries? Further steps? Deeper secrets to reality?Yes.Truly masterful vislae, those at the height of power and understanding, eventually seek the Labyrinth. To enter the Labyrinth is to leave the Actuality forever. Perhaps to die, or worse. Or perhaps to reach a new understanding of reality. To transcend. To answer questions others don’t even know to ask. To find oneself upon new shores. Entering the Labyrinth requires the highest mastery of magical power, knowledge, and skill. Few vislae can truly aspire to it, and even fewer succeed.Is it a maze? A test? A crucible? A threshold opening into a greater existence? There is only one way to find out . . .

Book 05:
Title: Book M
Author(s): Monte Cook, Shanna Germain
---
ISBN-10: 9781950568338 - ISBN-13: 1950568334 - ASIN: 085766719X
Published Date: 2022-08-31

HB Blurb: Even its name is a secret! Some say it comes from the Sodality of Vryn, which identifies thirteen currents of magic and gives each a letter designation—M is the 13th and most powerful. Others say the title refers to the original writer of the book, while still others believe it stands for mystery, or—perhaps most simply and obviously—magic.Whatever the source of its name, Book M is one of the rarest and most sought-after grimoires. It’s whispered to contain otherwise unknown spells, incantations, rituals, charms, hexes, and more. Plus potions, amulets, bezoars, spiritstones, and madstones, as well as other physical ephemera. Within its pages a vislae might even discover artifacts of great power.Not just a 120-page book (with new forte, long-form magic, and character and house secrets, plus more guidelines and advice for making magic even easier and more magical), this title also includes 200 new cards for spells, incantations, ephemera, and objects of power.
--------------------------------------------------

Book 06:
Title: The Nightside
Author(s): Monte Cook
---
ISBN-10:  - ISBN-13:  - ASIN: No ASIN found
Published Date: 
---
HB Blurb: Some say the Nightside is evil, but that’s a misunderstanding. Or at least an oversimplification. It is dark, that much is certain. Forbidden. Dangerous. Those who walk the Nightside Path meddle with the sinister. Those who call upon its forces risk much—perhaps all.The Nightside is your guide to this dangerous antithesis of the Path of Suns. Some who call upon this forbidden tome will undoubtedly be seen as villains, but though its use is risky, it is not inherently without benefit. If you are willing to accept that risk, you will find new fortes, new patrons, dozens of magical practices—minor and long-form—and Nightside locations and characters. And, of course, many secrets of the Nightside.Surely, vislae, these benefits outweigh the risks?This product contains The Nightside, a 192-page book, along with 40 Nightside magic cards, including spell, incantation, aggregate, ephemera, and object of power cards, plus 10 new Vance spell cards.
--------------------------------------------------

Book 07:
Title: Enchiridion of the Path
Author(s): Monte Cook
---
ISBN-10:  - ISBN-13:  - ASIN: 1950568040
Published Date: 
---
HB Blurb: Wise vislae, have you studied the realms beneath the suns? Have you planned your route along the Path, researched the wonders and dangers you will find, and prepared your parlays with the wardens? Or is your knowledge of the Path of Suns incomplete? Do you lack answers needed before one sets out on such a profound journey?Those answers you seek lie between these covers. This unique volume consists of dozens of documents from across Satyrine and beyond, detailing the secrets of the suns. Taken from old letters, treatises, arcane notes, and the pages of long-lost books, these are the fruits of your research, just waiting for you to harvest them.Each page is a handout; this book is a collection of artifacts and game props as well as a sourcebook. Tear this book apart. Share the pages with your players. Take their secrets for your own. And prepare to venture out along the Path of Suns.

Book 08:
Title: Invisible Sun Prop Set 2
Author(s): Sean K. Reynolds
---
ISBN-10:  - ISBN-13:  - ASIN: 
Published Date: 
---
HB Blurb: Part of what makes Invisible Sun so remarkable (in addition to the truly unique setting and the magical rules system) is the game’s immersive nature. The Black Cube contains, among the many hundreds of components, a dozens of props and handouts—little bits of the Actuality to share at your game table. Menus, business cards, signs, handbills, posters, train and theatre tickets, letterhead, brochures, postcards . . . the list goes on. Few things draw players into a game world, and make their eyes light up at the game table, like well-crafted props.Prop Set 2 gives you well over two dozen additional, all-new props for your Invisible Sun narrative—more, in fact, than the substantial number included in the Black Cube. Invitations, tickets, playbills, old letters, pages torn from mysterious books. Like everything Invisible Sun, these items are filled with hints, clues, hooks, and hidden truths. They bring the Actuality to life here in Shadow, and are a great aid to any Invisible Sun narrative!
--------------------------------------------------

Book 09:
Title: The Van Hauten Collection: Magical Praxis
Author(s): Monte Cook
---
ISBN-10:  - ISBN-13:  - ASIN: 
Published Date: 
---
HB Blurb: Surely, vislae, you need no reminder of the impact Elsbeth Van Hauten has had upon the standardization and categorization of magical practices. She compiled some of the most extensive lists of minor magic, long-form magic, and secret magical lore, gathering information from libraries and the usual sources and also—rumor has it—more than a few intrusions into the houses of vislae still exiled to Shadow. Van Hauten also traveled through the length of the Path of Suns and even along the Nightside Path to compile her grimoires. This is the fruit of her labor. Although she is long gone, her legacy of providing organized, clear, and concise lists and descriptions of so many magical praxis will forever earn her a place of reverence among vislae.
 
 If you own Book M or The Nightside, you can easily combine their cards for spells, ephemera, incantations, and so on with those from the Black Cube, putting them all in one place. But what about the long-form and minor magics contained within those products? Wouldn’t it be handy to gather all of those together into one source? This PDF gives you exactly that: a complete encyclopedia of every minor magic, long-form magic, and secret from every Invisible Sun source—all in one place for easy searching and reference. It will make your Invisible Sun game experience even better!

Title: Invisible Sun Prop-Crafting Kit
Author(s): Monte Cook

ISBN-10:  - ISBN-13:  - ASIN: 1939979838
Published Date: 
---
HB Blurb: The wide array of props and handouts in the Black Cube and Prop Set 2 include seemingly common items from around Satyrine, like menus, handbills, tickets, brochures, and business cards. Many of them harbor hints, hooks, and hidden truths about the Actuality. But perhaps your players would enjoy props custom made by you for your own specific narrative? Create official letters, secret messages, or hidden clues. Encode text in the mystic Invisible Sun glyphs. Maybe even add a wax seal, an embossed symbol, or similar element to props you create, to give them a really immersive, authentic feel.
 
 This kit includes scores of digital elements that make that possible, such as the IS Script font (the symbol script you see, among many other places, on the back of each book in the Black Cube); the IS Occult font (an arcane set of symbols used for a variety of magical spells and rituals); files for the symbols of each sun, with and without the sunray border shown on the Path of Suns and sun medallions, in a variety of useful file formats; similar files for the order symbols; files for the order letterheads (samples of which are included among the props in the Black Cube) in both letter and A4 sizes; similar files featuring common border designs used throughout Invisible Sun, plus other related graphic elements; icons and other spot art, including ants, clocks, ravens, spiders, and other elements you see frequently in the pages of the Invisible Sun books; instructions (and permission) to use these files to make to make not just handouts and props on paper, but also things like embossers, wax seals, stamps, and so on, to give those items an extra immersive quality.
