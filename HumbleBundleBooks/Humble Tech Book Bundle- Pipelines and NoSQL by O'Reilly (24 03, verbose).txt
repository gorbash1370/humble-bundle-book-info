HB Blurb: Machine learning systems are both complex and unique. Complex because they consist of many different components and involve many different stakeholders. Unique because they're data dependent, with data varying wildly from one use case to the next. In this book, you'll learn a holistic approach to designing ML systems that are reliable, scalable, maintainable, and adaptive to changing environments and business requirements.
Author Chip Huyen, co-founder of Claypot AI, considers each design decision--such as how to process and create training data, which features to use, how often to retrain models, and what to monitor--in the context of how it can help your system as a whole achieve its objectives. The iterative framework in this book uses actual case studies backed by ample references.
This book will help you tackle scenarios such as:

Engineering data and choosing the right metrics to solve a business problem
Automating the process for continually developing, evaluating, deploying, and updating models
Developing a monitoring system to quickly detect and address issues your models might encounter in production
Architecting an ML platform that serves across use cases
Developing responsible ML systems

HB Blurb: This practical guide provides a collection of techniques and best practices that are generally overlooked in most data engineering and data science pedagogy. A common misconception is that great data scientists are experts in the ""big themes"" of the discipline—machine learning and programming. But most of the time" these tools can only take us so far. In practice the smaller tools and skills really separate a great data scientist from a not-so-great one.Taken as a whole the lessons in this book make the difference between an average data scientist candidate and a qualified data scientist working in the field. Author Daniel Vaughan has collected extended and used these skills to create value and train data scientists from different companies and industries.With this book you will:Understand how data science creates valueDeliver compelling narratives to sell your data science projectBuild a business case using unit economics principlesCreate new features for a ML model using storytellingLearn how to decompose KPIsPerform growth decompositions to find root causes for changes in a metricDaniel Vaughan is head of data at Clip "the leading paytech company in Mexico.

HB Blurb: Serverless computing enables developers to concentrate solely on their applications rather than worry about where they've been deployed. With the Ray general-purpose serverless implementation in Python, programmers and data scientists can hide servers, implement stateful applications, support direct communication between tasks, and access hardware accelerators.
In this book, experienced software architecture practitioners Holden Karau and Boris Lublinsky show you how to scale existing Python applications and pipelines, allowing you to stay in the Python ecosystem while reducing single points of failure and manual scheduling. Scaling Python with Ray is ideal for software architects and developers eager to explore successful case studies and learn more about decision and measurement effectiveness.
If your data processing or server application has grown beyond what a single computer can handle, this book is for you. You'll explore distributed processing (the pure Python implementation of serverless) and learn how to:

Implement stateful applications with Ray actors
Build workflow management in Ray
Use Ray as a unified system for batch and stream processing
Apply advanced data processing with Ray
Build microservices with Ray
Implement reliable Ray applications
