HB Blurb: New government policy and regulation affect the environments in which organisations operate, bringing both risks potential opportunities. A key question is whether organisations are engaging with decision-makers and other key actors as effectively as they could. Are they managing to influence the policy and regulatory regime that shapes the markets in which they operate? Even more fundamentally, do they know who they should be interacting with or understand the formal and informal processes whereby they can present their concerns, views and ideas? Strategic Stakeholder Engagement and Communication: A Voice Behind the Curtain addresses these important questions.

HB Blurb: Based on research conducted at Villanova University’s School of Business, the book describes technology adoption in the 21st century. The innovator/early adopter/early majority/late majority/laggard innovation diffusion model first popularized by Everett Rogers in1962 is unrecognizable today. Even the rapid prototyping adoption models of the late 1990s have collapsed. This book presents a technology adoption process that is driven by competitive fear, speed and digital transformation. It is a process that is inexpensive, indiscriminate and completely disconnected from adoption categories or bell curves.
