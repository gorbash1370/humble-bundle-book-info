HB Blurb: You know that servers have log files and performance measuring tools and that traditional network devices have LEDs that blink when a port does something. You may have tools that tell you how busy an interface is, but mostly a network device is a black box.Network Flow Analysis opens that black box, demonstrating how to use industry-standard software and your existing hardware to assess, analyze, and debug your network.
Unlike packet sniffers that require you to reproduce network problems in order to analyze them, flow analysis lets you turn back time as you analyze your network. You’ll learn how to use open source software to build a flow-based network awareness system and how to use network analysis and auditing to address problems and improve network reliability. You’ll also learn how to use a flow analysis system; collect flow records; view, filter, and report flows; present flow records graphically; and use flow records to proactively improve your network. Network Flow Analysis will show you how to:

Identify network, server, router, and firewall problems before they become critical
Find defective and misconfigured software
Quickly find virus-spewing machines, even if they’re on a different continent
Determine whether your problem stems from the network or a server
Automatically graph the most useful data

And much more. Stop asking your users to reproduce problems. Network Flow Analysis gives you the tools and real-world examples you need to effectively analyze your network flow data. Now you can determine what the network problem is long before your customers report it, and you can make that silly phone stop ringing.

HB Blurb: System administrators need to stay ahead of new security vulnerabilities that leave their networks exposed every day. A firewall and an intrusion detection systems (IDS) are two important weapons in that fight, enabling you to proactively deny access and monitor network traffic for signs of an attack.Linux Firewalls discusses the technical details of the iptables firewall and the Netfilter framework that are built into the Linux kernel, and it explains how they provide strong filtering, Network Address Translation (NAT), state tracking, and application layer inspection capabilities that rival many commercial tools. You’ll learn how to deploy iptables as an IDS with psad and fwsnort and how to build a strong, passive authentication layer around iptables with fwknop.Concrete examples illustrate concepts such as firewall log analysis and policies, passive network authentication and authorization, exploit packet traces, Snort ruleset emulation, and more with coverage of these topics:Passive network authentication and OS fingerprintingiptables log analysis and policiesApplication layer attack detection with the iptables string match extensionBuilding an iptables ruleset that emulates a Snort rulesetPort knocking vs. Single Packet Authorization (SPA)Tools for visualizing iptables logsPerl and C code snippets offer practical examples that will help you to maximize your deployment of Linux firewalls. If you’re responsible for keeping a network secure, you’ll find Linux Firewalls invaluable in your attempt to understand attacks and use iptables—along with psad and fwsnort—to detect and even prevent compromises.
