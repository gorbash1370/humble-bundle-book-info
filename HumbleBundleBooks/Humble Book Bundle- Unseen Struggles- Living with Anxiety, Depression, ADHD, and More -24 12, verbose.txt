HB Blurb: Confront the psychological blocks that are holding you back—and become a fearless and peerless communicator.Winner of the 2023 PenCraft Best Book Award for Nonfiction, 2023 Nonprofit Authors Association Silver Award, 2023 Readers’ Favorite Bronze Medal Award for Business, and 2023 Dan Poynter’s Global Ebook Gold Award for Communications As a lifelong communication coach, Michelle Gladieux has discovered the four sneaky obstacles that can keep you from becoming an effective communicator:Hiding—Fearing your low self-confidence will expose your supposed weaknessesDefining—Putting too much stock into your assumptions and being quick to judge right and wrongRationalizing—Using “being realistic” to shield yourself from taking chances, engaging in conflict, or doing other scary but potentially rewarding actionsSettling—Stopping at good enough instead of pushing for something better What all these challenges have in common is they require taking risks—to reveal yourself, to question your beliefs, to take a leap of faith, or to move out of your comfort zone. As a response, each chapter includes a Pro Move, or a best practice, and an exercise designed to help you overcome your fears and become a powerful communicator. Courageous communication requires self-knowledge, practice, and a fierce desire to continually improve; this book is like having an expert coach along with you for every step of the journey.“[A] wonderful book.” —Karl W. Einolf, PhD, President, Indiana Institute of Technology

HB Blurb: “A tremendously empowering book of reflection and discovery . . . invites the reader to engage in practices that nurture the joy and fulfillment of living.” —Michael White, PhDIf you find yourself running away from fear, you’re running in the wrong direction. Fear demands that we move toward it, face it, and hear its messages. When we fail to do this, the price is high—chronic anxiety, sleeplessness, damaged relationships, skyrocketing pharmaceutical use, and more. In her enlightening book Joy from Fear, clinical psychologist Dr. Carla Marie Manly explains that fear is not the enemy we thought it was; fear, when faced with awareness, is the powerful ally and best friend we all need.Dr. Manly’s work is firmly based in science but goes far beyond presenting the dry facts. Joy from Fear offers page after page of real-life examples, insights, easy-to-use tools, and life-changing exercises. Coining the term transformational fear, Dr. Manly illuminates the importance of embracing fear’s messages for a transformed life filled with freedom and lasting happiness. “She shows a way, clearly and with certainty, to shift from fear that can tear a life apart to reimagining the role of fear in life.” —Thomas Moore, New York Times–bestselling author of Care of the Soul“An incomparable guidebook for those who wish to achieve lasting mental and emotional transformation.” —Dr. Orchid D. Johnson, PhD, LMFT, LPCC, and Board Certified PTSD Clinician“The concept of ‘transformational fear’ offers a depth of understanding that has been missing . . . Thank you, Dr. Manly, for bringing fear out of the darkness, to its place in the light where it belongs.” —Denise L. Wagner, PsyD, LCSW

HB Blurb: A guide to overcoming your fears so you can make decisions with confidence, conquer obstacles, and go after what really matters. Author of the bestselling motivational book Stop Anxiety from Stopping You, Dr. Helen Odessky describes what she has learned in fifteen years of helping people face their fears. Learn to face your fears and attain greater opportunities in your relationships, career, and life. Sometimes fear can be helpful. A few years ago, Dr. Helen Odessky, licensed clinical psychologist, anxiety expert, and speaker, found herself part of a minor fender-bender on a major interstate. Looking back at her daughter, she feared that if another car hit them, her daughter’s life would be in danger. A few minutes after retreating to another car in a safer location, an 18-wheeler barreled into her car and demolished it. Her fear saved both her daughter's life and her own.Stop Fear from Stopping You is about a different type of fear—the fear that is so prevalent that it often lies dormant—destroying dreams, career paths and relationships. Bad fear creates stories that cushion us from potential pain and failure—at the cost of our self-esteem, success, and personal happiness. Because fear is complex, we cannot afford merely to be fearless. Just “letting go” is not the answer. The real solution lies in learning to become fear-wise. In this inspirational book, Dr. Helen shows you how to harness the wisdom behind your fears and break through the barriers that block your success.Praise for Stop Fear from Stopping You“In such uncertain times, I’m grateful that Dr. Odessky has come out with this new book to help you tame your fears and live a fuller, calmer life where you are able to handle whatever comes your way. Join the thousands of others her words have helped and decide to take control. Start today. Start now.” —Dr. John Duffy, author of Parenting the New Teen in the Age of Anxiety“As an anxiety treatment specialist, I am always looking for tools and techniques to move my clients compassionately and effectively through panic and other forms of anxiety. This book offers practical, evidence-based exercises to assist anxiety sufferers in freeing themselves from the devastating symptoms of untreated anxiety. I recommend this book to anyone looking for actionable steps that they can take to teach anxiety to back off and quiet down.” —Debra Kissen, PhD, MHSA, clinical director of Light on Anxiety Treatment Center and author of The Panic Workbook for Teens
