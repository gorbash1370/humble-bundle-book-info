HB Blurb: The Insider’s Guide to Launching and Accelerating Your Cybersecurity Career! Cybersecurity is one of the world's fastest growing, most exciting fields--but that doesn't mean it's easy to enter the industry and succeed. Now there's a complete guide to creating a great cybersecurity career, whether you're migrating to cybersecurity from another field or already a cybersecurity professional. Building a Career in Cybersecurity doesn't teach detailed technical skills you can get from other books and videos. Instead, the author focuses on make-or-break knowledge you won't find elsewhere: personal strategy, planning, process, mindset, and the critical “soft skills” today's employers are desperate to find.
