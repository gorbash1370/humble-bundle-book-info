HB Blurb: Ogasawara Hiroki’s average life was turned upside-down the moment he became a babe magnet for a whole harem of sexy succubi. Hiroki has managed to court the attentions of a famous businesswoman, a talented idol, a beloved actress, an up-and-coming tennis prodigy, and he’s even attracted European royalty. Hiroki’s life is a busy one, and there’s never a dull moment: something which becomes even more apparent when Yue, the ruler of the succubus realm, barges into his house and asks for his help. The newest member of Hiroki’s harem, Alice, is a fledgling succubus who has little knowledge of the human world. Having spent most of her life in the succubus realm, Alice is naïve and unworldly, and she has no idea how to fit in. Help Hiroki show Alice around Tokyo, introduce her to her fellow succubi, and try not to let her get too anxious. Alice’s self-esteem has always been shaky, and if things go wrong, it might just spell disaster. Alice is a young succubus who has lived an isolated life. She knows little about the human world, and often worries that she doesn’t fit in. Alice finds it difficult to express herself and she’s incredibly awkward. Her anxieties make her a tricky succubus to manage, but she’s incredibly affectionate, and she’ll stop at nothing to ensure Hiroki knows just how much she adores him. Yue is the queen of the succubus realm, and she certainly acts like it. Aloof, haughty, and dignified, Yue simply oozes feminine grace and poise that some of the other succubi can only dream of. Yue might be young, but she is a force to be reckoned with, and she knows just how to get what she wants: Hiroki included. Ayu is a popular idol who has legions of fans all across Japan. Her cheery stage presence, her adorable appearance, and her humility only bolster her image as a ‘perfect idol’. Ayu is so adorable, most of her fans believe her not to be a flesh and blood woman, but an angel descended from heaven. They couldn’t, of course, be more mistaken. Ayu is, in actuality, a succubus, and she’s a devious one at that. Two-faced and incredibly bratty, Ayu will often badmouth her fans, though she has a soft spot for Hiroki. Cosmos is a ditzy airhead who marches to the beat of her own drum. She’s a social media superstar with masses of followers, and she spends her time posting provocative photographs of herself online to satiate her salivating simps. Though Cosmos’s dress sense might be peculiar, she isn’t particularly attention-hungry. She simply wants to make people happy… And she prioritizes Hiroki’s happiness above everybody else’s. Marina is a businesswoman with a level head and an eye for a good bargain. She’s renowned both for her cutting edge fashion sense and her cutting tongue in the boardroom, and she’s amassed mountains of money during the brief handful of years she’s been in the business. While Marina might seem like the sort to put her work above all else, she also knows when to cut loose and have fun. Marina’s not above having a drink or two to idle away the hours, and she’s particularly fond of pampering Hiroki. What’s the point in having so much money, after all, without a cute partner to lavish it on?

HB Blurb: Yori is a man on a mission. He’s a professional security guard who’ll take on any job if the price is right, and he’s been involved in any number of top secret operations with high stakes and large financial rewards. During one particular job, however, Yori receives quite the shock. While protecting an important, high classified briefcase whose contents are a mystery, Yori is accosted by a thief – and this thief is no ordinary criminal. This thief is, instead, a beautiful young woman. She has a curvy body, a pretty face, long, silky hair… And she’s wearing a bunny suit?! That’s pretty crazy – but what’s even crazier is her ability to stop bullets with her bare hands, her superhuman speed, and her augmented strength. Just who is this bunny girl, and what does she want with this briefcase? Yori is uncertain – but one thing is for sure. His life is about to be turned upside-down. Satomi is the first bunny girl Yori meets during his misadventures, and she’s by far the most powerful. Satomi is cocky and self-confident, but she has the abilities to back up her boasts, and she – like Yori – is a professional in her job. Satomi is ruthless when she’s on the job, and she’s willing to go to whatever lengths required to succeed in her missions. Behind closed doors, however, she’s a kind woman who takes good care of her allies. Riko is a cheerful, bubbly girl who might be something of an airhead. Instant noodles are her idea of fine dining, and she’s easy to please with her happy-go-lucky attitude. Despite her upbeat personality, however, Riko cares deeply for the plights of those who are downtrodden, and she’s made it her life’s mission to take down scummy businessmen who prey on the weak and the vulnerable. …Oh yes, and she’s also a bunny girl who can mindjack people. That’s also a thing. To Yuka, might makes right, and she’s not afraid of using violence to solve her problems. Her parents were duped into forfeiting their home when she was a young child, and she’s developed a dislike of fraudsters ever since. Afraid of being vulnerable, she’s resolved to fight on the side of justice, no matter the cost. Beneath her brash exterior, however, Yuka is surprisingly sweet-natured: something Yori soon comes to discover.

HB Blurb: This visual novel is the direct sequel to Sakura Succubus 6. After charming the sweet-natured Astorian princess, Stephania, and her maid, the serious, no-nonsense Elizabeth, Hiroki takes the pair of them on a tour of Tokyo alongside Cosmos, the cheerful e-girl, and Ayu, the grumpy idol. With a gaggle of adoring girls in tow, Hiroki visits a maid café, drinks bubble tea, and goes on a trip to a theme park. His days with Stephania pass by in a blur, each one more exciting than the last… But there’s danger afoot, as Hiroki soon realizes there’s somebody watching him from the shadows: somebody who seems to have taken an unhealthy interest in him and his harem. Who is this mysterious stranger and what do they want? Hiroki is uncertain – but, if left unchecked, this person could cause chaos the likes of which Hiroki has never before known. Stephania is the princess of Astoria: a small European country situated near Germany. Stephania is adored by her doting parents who ensured, throughout her childhood, that she never wanted for anything. Raised in a palace and tended to by droves of servants, Stephania has it all… But, despite her august upbringing, Stephania grew up lonely, without many friends. After meeting Hiroki, she soon falls in love with him, and she quickly seizes on the opportunity to visit him in Japan. This is the first time Stephania has ever left her home country, and she’s incredibly excited by everything Japan has to offer. For Stephania, this really is the trip of a lifetime. Elizabeth is Stephania’s devoted maid who would do almost anything for her lady’s sake. Elizabeth takes her duties as a maid very seriously, and there’s nothing that brings her more joy than making Stephania happy. Elizabeth might act cool and serious, but she is fiercely protective of Stephania. If anything were to happen to her young mistress, her icy exterior would surely shatter, revealing just how passionate she can truly be. Cosmos Moretti is a half-Italian, half-Japanese succubus and a popular internet personality with millions of followers on RapidPound. Cosmos is renowned for taking photographs of herself wearing skimpy clothing, but Cosmos herself is rather naïve, and she doesn’t fully understand why her photos are considered so provocative. A daydreamy airhead who lives in cloud cuckoo land, Cosmos is a romantic at heart, and she fantasizes about one day marrying Hiroki. She is very open and earnest in her affections, which makes her perfect girlfriend material. Ikue Ayu is Japan’s top idol, and she’s also a succubus. Though Ayu acts cute and sweet while performing, she can be vicious about her fans when the cameras aren’t rolling. Ayu is a hard worker who’s prone to pushing herself to improve her craft, which further exacerbates her foul moods. It’s rare she gets any time off, and being under the spotlight 24/7 exhausts her. Ayu spends so much time publicly playing a character for the sake of her fans, she finds it hard to be honest with her true feelings in private. She often snaps at Hiroki, but deep down, she loves him dearly. Secretly, she wishes she could be more openly affectionate like Cosmos, but she’s too much of a tsundere. Maybe one day she’ll learn!Yue is the queen of the succubus realm and the power she wields is second to none. Yue might not be famous in the human world, unlike Cosmos and Ayu, but the respect her subjects bequeath her helps bolster her strength. Yue, much like Cosmos and Ayu, is head over heels for Hiroki, whom she knew before her ascension to the throne, back when she lived in the human realm. Yue has a short temper and she can be rather possessive, but she’s been working to change her ways. Displeased with how clingy she used to be, she’s trying earnestly to become more open to the idea of sharing Hiroki, hard though it might be. It’s difficult to be in love with such a popular man!

HB Blurb: Kitagawa Shouhei is a young man who lives in a quiet town, where he runs his deceased grandfather’s bookshop. His life is an ordinary one, but he’s content with it, even if he hasn’t had a girlfriend in years. Shouhei is happy enough to while away his days among stacks of old, dusty books, while chatting with his favorite (and only) colleague, the sweet-natured and mild-mannered Asa… But his luck with women takes a sudden turn for the better when Asa asks him to go to the local gym with her, to help her shed some extra weight. While at the gym, Shouhei runs into two very different women: the haughty and aloof Tsumiki, and the cheerful, energetic Ranko, with whom Shouhei shares a complicated past. Join Shouhei as he helps Asa with her fitness regimen, all while trying to win over the icy Tsumiki and processing his feelings for Ranko. Whether Shouhei will end up with Asa, Tsumiki, or Ranko (or all three of them) is up to you in this visual novel. Characters: Asa works at Shouhei’s bookshop as his most trusted (and, indeed, only) employee. She’s a quiet girl with low self-confidence, but her gentle smile ensures she always leaves her customers feeling satisfied. Asa is very short, which is something she’s horribly embarrassed about. She tries to counteract this by wearing heels, though she can’t help but envy popular idols and models for being so tall and willowy. She’s liked Shouhei for a long time, but she’s too shy to act on her feelings. Ranko used to be Shouhei’s girlfriend, back when the both of them were in university. They’ve since broken up, however, and Shouhei didn’t imagine he would ever see her again – that is, until he sees her at his local gym. Ranko is a cheerful, upbeat girl who doesn’t sweat the small stuff. She’s always smiling, laughing, and cracking jokes, which makes her fun to hang around with – though it can be hard to tell whether she’s being serious or not. Tsumiki is an aloof, haughty girl who acts like an aristocrat. She takes against Shouhei after their first meeting, and she’s aggressively rude towards him. Tsumiki might seem unapproachable, but she does have a sweet side. She’s a huge fan of romance novels, though she’s never been in a relationship before herself. She dreams about being swept off her feet one day by a handsome prince, and having her own happily ever after ending… But that’ll never happen, right?

HB Blurb: In this visual novel Takagi Haru is a normal university student with an abundance of love for the stars. As a member of his university’s astronomy club, alongside the sweet but somewhat ditzy Hiyori, Haru means to devote his life to the stars. He doesn’t have any time to mess around with cute girls… At least, that’s what he always thought – until an alien princess from another planet, Ena, lands on his lap, and declares herself to be his future wife. Haru ends up taking Ena in, as she has nowhere else to go, and Ena and Hiyori soon hit it off. Now, the three of them are good friends (or perhaps something more) – but malevolent forces are seeking to undermine their relationship. A new professor has arrived at Haru’s university. Her name is Professor Sakai, and she composes herself in a beautiful, elegant manner. She is undoubtedly alluring, and Haru is soon drawn to her – but Professor Sakai seems to have her sights set on Ena. Has Professor Sakai discovered Ena’s secret identity as a runaway alien princess – and what does she mean to do with Ena? That’s something Haru has to figure out, else Ena might soon find herself in a sticky situation. Ena is an alien princess who comes from a far-off planet called Corval. She was raised as a member of alien royalty, and she’s used to the finer things in life. She isn’t a snob, however, and she enjoys nothing more than lounging around Haru’s apartment in one of his old button-up shirts, eating snacks and reading manga. Ena is a cheerful, bubbly girl, and she’s capable of brightening up anybody’s day with a single smile. If she wasn’t already an alien princess, she might make a good idol! Hiyori is a kind-natured girl one year Haru’s senior, and the president of the astronomy club. She might be even more obsessed with the stars than Haru, as she seems to believe, owing to a star-shaped birthmark on her chest, that she herself is an extraterrestrial. Hiyori’s parents are both exceedingly wealthy, but she doesn’t seem to get along with them very well. She doesn’t often talk about her family, and would far rather hang out with Haru and Ena. Professor Sakai (given name unknown) is a newbie professor at Haru and Hiyori’s university. She might look cool and mature, with her icy intellect and her dark, sophisticated fashion sense, but she’s actually something of a klutz: a fact she’s very embarrassed about. She seems to have taken an especial interest in Ena: a development which causes Haru no shortage of stress. Professor Sakai might be pretty, but what, exactly, is she plotting…?

HB Blurb: Take control of Ren in this visual novel, a young man who's just started working in the idol industry. Ren has adored idols from a young age, and now his love is about to be rewarded. The production company he works at has decided to put him in charge of a newbie idol group comprised of three unique young women: the cheerful, energetic, Akko; the quiet, perplexing Ibuki; and the proud, haughty Chiyoko. Though these girls are all eager to become idols, they've all their own unique ideas about what being an idol entails - and, as if that wasn't bad enough, they seem incapable of agreeing on anything. On paper, they're a team, but in reality, they're always arguing! Ren only has a month to whip these girls into shape. It's up to him to organize Akko, Ibuki, and Chiyoko's daily routines, while earning them both fans and funds. The girls can also take on jobs at the local talent agency, the success of which is determined by match 3 gameplay, to further boost their popularity. Then, when the month ends, a competition awaits, wherein only the most talented idol group will be crowned the victor. Help Akko, Ibuki, and Chiyoko achieve their dreams... And maybe, if Ren makes a good enough impression, they might just fall in love with him, too.Akko is a cheerful girl who's rarely seen without a smile on her face. She acts as a mediator when Ibuki and Chiyoko inevitably come to blows, and she's always striving to make others happy. Akko was born in a small fishing village, and she spent her childhood helping her parents run their humble inn. As a result, Akko's no stranger to hard work, and her home-making skills are impeccable. Her miso soup really is delicious! While Akko might appear boundlessly optimistic, she's a bit self-conscious about her humble origins. She finds the bright lights of Tokyo overwhelming, and at times even she needs a shoulder to lean on. Ibuki is a girl of few words, yet the words she's able to articulate are all utterly baffling. Though quiet, she seems to take a perverse delight in making other people uncomfortable. Ibuki particularly enjoys teasing Chiyoko, given the cat-eared diva is so prone to overreacting. The two can often be found arguing, despite Akko's best attempts to divert them. Ren, too, is another one of Ibuki's favorite targets. Her flirting with Ren is so aggressive it borders on sexual harassment, but just how serious is Ibuki in her pursuit of her producer? That, alas, is a mystery. Chiyoko a haughty, aloof madam who fancies herself as a being superior to all other lifeforms. She comes from a wealthy family, her father being the president of a large electronics company, and she's lived a life of luxury. Though Chiyoko is undeniably privileged, she seems discontented with her lot in life. Fiercely independent, she hates the thought of coasting by on her family's success, and she's determined to become an idol using her own merits. Chiyoko also seems to think she's a cat, for some reason, and peppers most of her sentences with 'meow'. Why she does this is anybody's guess.  Features:

HB Blurb: Ogasawara Hiroki is a thoroughly average man. A photographer by trade, he works long and demanding hours every day, all the while overseen by his tyrannical boss. Living in the middle of Tokyo on a paltry salary, Hiroki resides in a small, run-down apartment, and eats instant noodles to survive. His life can hardly be called ‘glamorous’… Until one day, that is, when he’s tasked with taking photos of Japan’s top idol, Ikue Ayu. One thing leads to another, and Hiroki soon finds himself at the mercy of three beautiful women – all of them celebrities. There’s the cute idol Ayu, the sultry businesswoman Marina, and the airheaded social media star Cosmos. They’re all rich, famous, and extremely well-endowed, and they should be utterly unattainable… But, for some reason, they’re insatiably attracted to Hiroki! According to Marina, these three women are all succubi, and they find Hiroki’s scent intoxicating. They can’t get enough of him – and soon, Hiroki’s average life becomes anything but. Ayu is a super famous idol whose name is known across Japan. She’s revered for her cute stage persona and her seemingly humble nature. During her concerts, she never fails to thank her fans, and her enthusiasm is contagious! ...That’s just how it appears, however. Deep down, Ayu is a scheming vixen who regards her fans as mere stepping stones, and values money above all else. She’s so avaricious, she claims to be ‘moneysexual’, and she spurns the advances of men… At least, she did, until she met Hiroki. Marina is a wealthy businesswoman who owns a well-known clothing company. Though she’s only thirty-one, she’s one of the richest women in Japan, and she’s respected by men and woman more than twice her age. Marina is a coolly confident beauty. She isn’t the sort to fluster easily, and she has no qualms about taking whatever she wants. She’s domineering, with a sadistic streak, but she has a motherly side, and she’s good at dispensing advice. Cosmos is a popular social media star, with over three million followers on RapidPound. Cosmos shot to stardom after posting a series of semi-nude photos of herself online, which went viral. Since then, she’s been revered as the sexiest, most daring RapidPounder of all time. Though Cosmos dresses and acts in a provocative manner, this isn’t entirely intentional. At heart, she’s a naïve girl, with no genuine understanding of the effect her half-naked body elicits in the opposite (and, in some cases, same) sex. This often gets her in trouble, though she can’t fathom why. Cosmos is known for lewd photos, but she’s a sweetheart who believes in true love. She dreams of one day meeting a handsome prince who’ll sweep her off her feet.

HB Blurb: Ogasawara Hiroki is a thoroughly average man… or, at least, he was. That soon changed, however, when a meeting with one of Japan’s most famous idols turns his life upside down. Hiroki soon learns, after a series of increasingly improbable events, that several of Japan’s most famous female celebs are actually succubi – and his scent makes him irresistible to them! Now, three beautiful women are vying for his attention: the two-faced idol Ayu, the mature businesswoman Marina, and the ditzy social media star, Cosmos. It’s hard enough for Hiroki to juggle his demanding job as a photographer with three potential girlfriends, but things are about to get even harder. A refined actress, Hifumi, now has her eye on Hiroki, as does a cheery sportswoman, Hazel. Hiroki’s harem is set to gain even more members… But does he have enough time and energy to give these women what they want? Ayu is a famous idol known throughout Japan. She’s famous for her good looks and her cutesy stage persona, but all this is a front. Unbeknownst to Ayu’s loyal fans, she’s secretly a foul-tempered brat who loves money above all else. She isn’t a particularly pleasant person, but she knows how to turn on the charm whenever she wants something – but alas! Hiroki knows too much of her wily ways to be fooled. Marina is a wealthy businesswoman who owns her own company. She’s only thirty-one, but she’s incredibly successful, and courts a good deal of awe and respect from the upper echelons of society. She has a bit of a sadistic streak, and likes to tease Hiroki, but she (unlike Ayu) knows when to draw the line, and would never deliberately hurt someone she cares for. Cosmos is a social media star with a huge presence on RapidPound. She has over three million followers, and she devotes herself to them fully: forever taking photos of herself dressed up in cute, slightly suggestive outfits. Though Cosmos has a lot of fans, she doesn’t have very many friends. Teased by her fellow succubi for her slow, spacey nature, Cosmos finds it hard to gauge how she’s supposed to interact with others. No matter what she does or says, it never comes out quite right. For a ‘social’ media star, she finds being ‘social’ incredibly hard! Hifumi is an actress who has been a staple of the Japanese movie industry since the tender age of eighteen. Now a veteran, with many years on the silver screen under her belt, her name is a household one, and she has legions of fans across the globe. Hifumi is a refined, elegant woman who loves all things quintessentially Japanese. The very definition of a ‘Yamato Nadeshiko’, Hifumi is diligent, caring, and incredibly good at cooking… But, for some reason, Ayu and Cosmos seem to distrust her. Perhaps there’s more behind her sweet smile than she lets on? Hazel is an up-and-coming tennis star born from a Japanese mother and an American father. A cheerful and energetic girl, Hazel approaches life with nothing less than 110%, and she’s almost always seen with a blinding smile. Though relatively young, she demands a captive audience during every match, and has quite the fanbase. She’s so bubbly, it really is impossible to hate her! There are several curious rumors circulating about her online, however, which catch Hiroki’s interest. Hazel’s hiding far more than her wide grin suggests!

HB Blurb: This Visual Novel picks up where Sakura Sucubus 5 left off, Ogasawara Hiroki finds himself in Astoria: a small European country with a chilly climate, where it often snows. Hiroki went to Astoria as Hifumi’s plus one, after the famous actress and reigning karuta queen was invited to stay in the royal palace at Princess Stephania’s behest. Stephania originally intended to challenge Hifumi to another karuta match, after previously losing to her – but, upon meeting Hiroki, Stephania soon falls for him. Hiroki is already one of the most envied men in Japan (if not, the world), owing to the recently publicized news of his relationship with Yamamoto Hifumi, not to mention his ongoing affairs with the famous businesswoman Wakatsuki Marina, and the tennis star Hazel Williams, but now he finds himself presented with yet another adoring woman. Hiroki used to be average, but now his life is anything but! Will Hiroki’s relationship with Stephania work out? Will the pair of them be able to stay together, even when Hiroki returns to Japan – and, perhaps more worryingly, will Hiroki be able to withstand the hatred of his co-workers? It’s hard being so popular! Hifumi is an actress who has appeared in a slew of popular movies over the last decade. She tends to appear in a lot of period dramas, and most of her roles are of demure, refined women. In her private life, Hifumi is fairly traditional herself, what with her fondness for traditional Japanese clothes and for traditional Japanese sports, but she isn’t quite as reserved as people tend to think. Hifumi is, in fact, a succubus, and she’s not shy about making the moves on Hiroki – or about letting him know just how much she adores him. Successful businesswoman by day, succubus by night, Marina is one of the oldest members of Hiroki’s harem. Fabulously wealthy, but also level-headed, it often falls upon Marina to keep the younger succubi in line: Ayu and Cosmos in particular. Marina likes to take charge, both in the boardroom and the bedroom, but she has a gentle side, too. She’s more compassionate than she looks, and she loves Hiroki and her silly succubus sisters a good deal – even if they annoy her. Hazel is a tennis star whose quick serves and inexhaustible energy have taken the sporting world by storm. There’s nothing Hazel loves more than the thrill of facing off against a tough opponent – apart, perhaps, from seducing pretty girls (receptionists with flower-themed names in particular). Hazel is so perpetually cheerful it borders on aggressive, and she talks so much, it can be hard to get a word in edgeways around her. Still, she’s a lot of fun to be with, and it’s easy to relax and unwind around her – when she’s not trying to force people to go jogging at 05:00 AM. Stephania is the young princess of Astoria. Born into a life of luxury, Stephania nonetheless grew up lonely, as her over-protective parents rarely allowed her to leave the palace. Stephania is polite and softly-spoken, but she has a passionate side which comes bursting out whenever she plays karuta. She might seem sweet and innocent, but she also has something of a mischievous streak, and, as a child, one of her dearest wishes was to run away from home and join the circus. Now, however, she dreams about being Hiroki’s girlfriend. Elizabeth is Stephania’s maid, who is intensely devoted to her young mistress. She’s incredibly talented, and can cook, clean, sew, and – in short – do absolutely anything that’s expected of her. She can even give kissing lessons, should the need arise. Elizabeth is aware that Stephania has feelings for Hiroki, and she seems determined to pair the two of them together. Selfless to a fault, she only wants to see Stephania smile – but how does Elizabeth feel about Hiroki herself?

HB Blurb: In this visual novel Ogasawara Hiroki was a thoroughly ordinary man, until one fateful night, where - quite inadvertently - he learns of the existence of succubi. After meeting and wooing a series of succubi, Hiroki is now prepared to settle down with his harem and enjoy a quiet life. Fate, however, has other plans, after Hifumi becomes embroiled with Princess Stephania Sofia Maria Isabella: a noblewoman who hails from the small European country, Astoria. Stephania, as it transpires, is a big fan of Japan, and of Japanese culture, and - having lived an isolated life within the palace's walls - she's overjoyed at meeting a Japanese beauty like Hifumi. After tasting defeat by Hifumi's hands in the karuta championships, Stephania extends an invitation to Hifumi. Stephania asks Hifumi to stay with her in Astoria, so she might teach her about karuta, and share with her stories about Japan. Not wanting to travel to Astoria on her own, Hifumi invites Hiroki alongside her, and - through a series of happenstances - Marina and Hazel find themselves tagging along for the ride. In Astoria, Hiroki meets and befriends both Princess Stephania and her dutiful maid, Elizabeth. The days pass, and both the princess and her maid begin to show an interest in Hiroki. There's something a touch unsettling about Elizabeth, however; something which immediately catches Marina's attention. Could Elizabeth be more than she's letting on - and what, exactly, is she scheming? Hifumi is a well-known actress who has been working in the movie industry for many years. Her fame is so great, even Hiroki's father is a fan of hers. Hifumi appears elegant and demure, but she can be surprisingly aggressive when it comes to matters of romance. She dreams about marrying Hiroki one day, and she's determined to set her plans into motion so she can one day wear a white dress. In addition to being a national superstar, an incredible cook, and a hopeful bride-to-be, Hifumi is the reigning queen of karuta. She has held this title for four years running; a fact which Stephania admires her for. Marina is a wealthy businesswoman who owns her own company. As one of the oldest succubi in Hiroki's harem, she often finds herself in the role of a disciplinarian, and is forever being obliged to quell Ayu and Cosmos's silly arguments. Marina might be bossy and quick to take charge, but she can be gentle despite this. She refers to Hiroki as her 'darling', and she's determined to let him know how much she cares for him... At least, she would - if she wasn't so busy attending various business meetings! Hazel is a tennis star with a Japanese mother and an American father. She's a cheerful, free-spirited woman, who often says whatever she's thinking, whenever she thinks it, often to Marina's irritation. Hazel loves both pretty women and handsome men, and she isn't ashamed to admit it. While staying in Astoria, Hazel spends her time drooling over the maids, while decrying Hiroki's popularity with the austere Elizabeth. Why, Hazel wants to know, can't she have her own retinue of maids to dote upon her?! Life just isn't fair! Stephania is the princess of Astoria, a small European country that borders Germany and the Netherlands. As a princess, Stephania grew up in a palace, and has never wanted for anything. Her upbringing was a blessed one but, owing to the over-protectiveness of her parents, Stephania knows little about the outside world, and is incredibly naïve. Stephania is invested in Japan and Japanese culture, and she can speak the language fluently. She is particularly fond of karuta, and spends hours every day honing her craft, in the hopes of one day becoming the reigning queen of karuta. Elizabeth is Stephania's loyal maid. A polite woman, but somewhat aloof, it can be hard to discern what she's thinking. Despite appearing emotionless, Elizabeth takes quite the shine to Hiroki upon meeting him. She appears drawn to him, and is willing to go to great lengths to catch his attention. When questioned about this, however, she claims she is acting in Stephania's best interests. Whatever Elizabeth's true intentions, it's apparent she is dedicated to her mistress, whom she adores beyond all reason.

HB Blurb: Ogasawara Hiroki was once an ordinary man, but his life has now taken a distinctly unordinary turn. Quite unwittingly, he stumbled upon a well-kept secret which flipped his humdrum existence upside-down: namely, that several of Japan's most famous female celebrities are succubi. These succubi fall for Hiroki in droves, and soon he obtains quite the harem. His gaggle of adoring succubi include the two-faced idol, Ikue Ayu; the ditzy social media star, Cosmos; the sadistic businesswoman, Marina; the elegant actress, Hifumi; the cheerful tennis player, Hazel; and the aloof succubus princess, Yue. After narrowly escaping a lifetime of imprisonment in the succubus realm, Hiroki is ready to kick back and relax. Ayu invites him on a vacation to her private beach house in Okinawa, and Hiroki is happy to accept. The other succubi come along for the ride, and a week of summertime fun begins. Join Hiroki as he breaks up vicious pillow fights, teaches Cosmos how to swim, and (begrudgingly) goes jogging with Hazel, all the while deepening his bonds with his adoring harem. Ayu is a famous idol beloved by men and women alike across Japan. Her songs are peppy and adorable; her stage outfits pink and frilly; her attitude sweet and innocent. That's the image she wants to project... but, in actuality, the real Ayu is quite different. She's cold and calculating, and some of her more disdainful expressions could curdle milk. She is very fond of Hiroki despite herself, however, and she's slowly becoming more honest with her feelings towards him. Marina is a wealthy businesswoman who owns her own company. She is one of the oldest of Hiroki's harem, and tries to act like a mature big sister should. She is generally calm and level-headed, but she's highly sensitive about her age - a fact which Ayu mocks mercilessly. Marina might act commandeering, but she has a soft side she only shows to those she loves. Away from the office and on the beach, Marina is more willing than she otherwise would be to let her hair down, and show Hiroki how cute she can really be. Cosmos is a social media star with a highly successful RapidPound account, which boasts over three million followers. Cosmos makes a living taking spicy photos of herself for her ever-growing audience, in a variety of costumes and poses. Cosmos loves her fans dearly, but she loves Hiroki even more. She's eager to please, and willing to do anything to make Hiroki happy... But, since she's an airhead, she sometimes takes things a bit too far. Hifumi is a well-regarded actress who has been working in the movie industry for over a decade. She's so popular, even Hiroki's father is a big fan of hers. Hifumi is an elegant, demure woman, who typically wears luxurious kimonos. On the beach, however, she prefers to dress more casually, in a baggy shirt and shorts. This is a side of Hifumi that her fans have never seen before, and it's all for Hiroki's sake. She might have changed up her look, but Hifumi is just as doting as ever, and she dreams of one day being Hiroki's wife. Hazel is a tennis star with a Japanese mother and an American father. She's unfailingly cheerful and upbeat, and is rarely seen without a big smile. She loves exercising, and is determined to get Hiroki to join her on her early morning jogs, even if it kills him. Hazel has a penchant for both pretty women and handsome men. She's very fond of Lady Yue, but she's just as fond of Hiroki. Unable to choose between them, Hazel has, instead, opted to love them both equally. Yue is the princess of the succubus realm. She may appear cool and aloof, but she has thawed out somewhat following the events of Sakura Succubus #3. Yue has spent most of the life in the succubus realm, governing he people. As such, she has few opportunities to enjoy the human world. She's determined to have some fun during the summer - and of course, she wants Hiroki to compliment her on her swimsuit.

HB Blurb: Ogasawara Hiroki was a normal man, until a chance meeting with Japan’s top idol turns his life around. He soon learns that many members of Japan’s elite are actually succubi – and, what’s more, there’s something about his scent which makes them insatiably attracted to him. Hiroki amasses a harem of five beautiful and accomplished women: Ayu, the famous idol; Cosmos, the airheaded social media star; Marina, the level-headed businesswoman; Hifumi, the elegant actress; and Hazel, the chipper tennis player. Managing his full-time job as a photographer alongside an army of clingy succubi girlfriends is a challenge, but it’s a welcome one. Hiroki’s fortunes are on the up, and his future seems rosy. At least, it did… until an encounter with a woman from his past changes everything. This woman introduces herself as Yue, the succubus queen. She and Hiroki share a deep bond, and now she intends to whisk Hiroki away to the succubus realm to keep him for her own. Trapped with Yue, Hiroki is faced with an ultimatum: will he succumb to her advances, or will he try to escape? Ikue Ayu, known as ‘Ayu-Ayu’ by her fans, is one of Japan’s top idols. She’s cute, bubbly, and incredibly humble – but this is nothing more than a front which masks a far more cynical persona. Ayu believes herself to be a queen, and she routinely disparages her fans for their slavish adoration. Stuck-up and arrogant, Ayu is quite a handful when she lets her cute persona drop – but, despite all that, she has a soft spot for Hiroki. Catch her admitting to that, though. Wakatsuki Marina is an intelligent, level-headed businesswoman. As one of the oldest of the succubi, she often acts as an authority figure, and isn’t afraid to dole out discipline. Incredibly wealthy and beautiful to boot, Marina is a catch who’s revered by many. Her only faults would be her short temper (particularly where Ayu’s antics are concerned) and her fondness for drinking. Cosmos Moretti is a part-Japanese, part-Italian succubus who works as a social media star. She uploads lots of saucy photos for her fans on the popular image-sharing website. She has more followers on RapidPound than even Ayu, and – unlike Ayu – she loves and cherishes every single one of them. Devote to her fans, Cosmos wants to make them all smile… But her devotion to Hiroki is stronger, even, than that. Yamamto Hifumi as a famous actress, and the oldest of the five succubi pursuing Hiroki. Kind and mild-mannered, with a penchant for karuta and cooking, she is the epitome of the phrase ‘Yamato Nadeshiko’. Hifumi is a motherly figure who prides herself on settling disputes with love and compassion, as opposed to violence. She particularly enjoys doting on Hiroki, and nothing makes her happier than being used as a lap pillow. Hazel Williams is an up-and-coming tennis star whose name is slowly but surely becoming more known. Almost always seen with a wide smile, Hazel’s the sort of girl who can cheer anybody up. She might seem irreverent, but her determination is second to none, and she spends hours at the gym at a time. She goes jogging regularly, is a proponent of healthy eating, and has iron self-control… when it comes to working out. Her self-control in regards to handsome men and pretty women, alas, is a different matter.

HB Blurb: Story: Dive into the magical world of Asaph Online in this  visual novel  , where Kotone is a feared dark witch with impressive and extensive magical powers, capable of defeating the strongest of foes with a snap of her fingers. In real life, however, Kotone is an average woman who works an average job, with a below average relationship with her estranged parents. Every day that passes is the same, and Kotone soon grows tired of her monotonous routine. If only she could enter a world like Asaph, filled with fantastical creatures and frightening monsters… but Asaph Online is only a game. There’s no way a game could ever become a reality. At least, that’s what Kotone used to think – until a mysterious force summons her to the world she has traversed so many times through her computer screen. Now, Kotone isn’t just Kotone, but the dark witch Viola – and, freed from her societal obligations, she finally decides to have some fun! Viola: Viola is the name Kotone gave to her character in Asaph Online. Upon awakening in Asaph, Kotone inherits Viola’s appearance, her magical powers, and her name. Viola is a dark witch with unimaginable powers, who is feared by everybody in Asaph. Many have tried to challenge her, but none have emerged victorious. She enjoys grinding people down beneath her heel (sometimes literally), and treats those around her as little more than playthings. She’s a deeply sadistic, dangerous woman… but even she has a soft side. Neve: Neve is Viola’s trusted most trusted maid, who would do anything to help her mistress. Neve is a member of the darkling race, which is reviled throughout Asaph as being savage and hostile, but Neve eschews these unfair perceptions. She is a diligent, loyal, industrious girl – but she may be a touch too devoted. She adores Viola, and becomes irrationally angry at any perceived slights against her beloved mistress. Self-sacrificing and hard-working though she is, Neve can be rather scary when she wants. If she were to fight seriously, she may even be able to defeat demons. Fion: Fion is a young, put-upon lass from a huge family, who works hard to ensure all her brothers and sisters have enough food to eat… At least, that’s what she says, but Neve isn’t entirely convinced. Fion might look like a sweet, innocent thing, looks can be deceiving, and she’s far craftier than she initially appears. Features:

HB Blurb: The land of Lemuria was once in turmoil. Ruled over by the evil demon queen, Gunhild, the people lived every day in fear and strife… until the brave female knight, Cressida, destroyed her. For the last thirty years, Lemuria has been at peace. Knights like Cressida are no longer needed to protect the masses – but Cressida’s daughter, Estelle, is determined to follow in her mother’s footsteps. Not content to spend the rest of her days in her parents’ bakery, our young heroine vows to take up the sword and go on a fantastic adventure… But things don’t quite work out that way! Despite her lofty ambitions, Estelle is sheltered and naïve. Less than a week into her adventure, she’s hoodwinked by a crafty catgirl, and then she has to content with a wildly flirtatious elven princess who keeps making advances on her! How will Estelle ever manage to make her dream come true?! Estelle is the heroine of the story. Though a young adult in her early twenties, she has spent most of her life sheltered and coddled by her overprotective parents. She wants to become a brave knight, but her clumsiness often gets the better of her. Felicia is a seductive elven princess who hails from the land of Gris. As per elven custom, Felicia must travel across the land and help those in need, in order to prove herself as a worthy successor to her mother’s throne. Felicia comes from a vast family with dozens of siblings. As the oldest, she’s also the loudest, and she almost never stops talking. She’s perpetually cheerful and optimistic, and more than a little airheaded, but her skills with a sword are impeccable. Tart is a self-proclaimed ‘magical cat witch’. Though she looks sweet and unassuming, she possesses incredible magical powers. Tart is mischievous and deceptive by nature. She makes a living through thievery, swindling, and stealing. She particularly loves taking advantage of cute girls – especially if she gets to see them cry. Rune is a wolfgirl who lives deep in the Lemurian forest. Her grasp of common Lemurian is somewhat shaky, and she finds it hard to communicate, but her passion always shines through. Serious and dutiful, Rune is a good ally to have. Like a guard dog, she’ll fiercely defend those she considers her comrades – but if you get on her bad side, she’ll hold a grudge for years.

HB Blurb: Sakura MMO Extra is a sequel to Sakura MMO #3, which takes place after the harem ending. Several months have passed since Viola and her ragtag party saved the realm of Asaph from impending destruction. Now left with little else to do, Viola whiles away her time accepting quests from the guild in Lynton, but none of them pose a challenge. Viola's life in Asaph might be perfect, what with her harem of cute girls to dote on her, but it's also perfectly boring. Dissatisfied with a lack of strong enemies to fight, Viola turns her attention to a business proposal brokered by Lynton's guild mistress, Maidie. Maidie plans to start up a maid café in Lynton, and she wants Viola, Neve, Fion, and Eleri to lend her a helping hand! Viola agrees to her offer, despite Neve's nay-saying, and a brand new chapter of Viola's life in Asaph begins. Join Viola as she works as a maid, choose which member of her harem to dote upon, and watch her embark upon a brand new adventure. Viola is the heroine of the Sakura MMO series. Her real name is Kotone, and she was born in Japan, but strange circumstances brought her to Asaph. She's known throughout Asaph as the dark witch, and she has immense powers. She's so infamous, she has to disguise herself while going out in public, for fear of causing unrest. She's something of a sadist, and there's nothing she loves more than tormenting cute girls. Neve is Viola's loyal maid. She adores her mistress, and would do anything for her - even morally dubious things. Though Neve appears polite and mild-mannered, she has quite the fiery temper. She's fiercely protective of Viola, and she will not hesitate to harm anybody who dares make fun of her lady. Fion is a cheerful, energetic girl who spent many years living on the streets. As an ex-thief, she's quick with her fingers, and she's incredibly devious. Fion is very fond of Viola, who helped reunite her with her older sister, Holly. Affectionate as a cat, there's nothing she loves more than cuddling up with her mistress. Eleri is a stoic, socially-awkward woman who hails from Japan, much like Viola. She, too, was summoned to Asaph, and ever since has worked hard honing her swordsmanship. She fancies herself as a knight, and she takes her duties very seriously. She often trains herself to the point of exhaustion, much to Viola's concern. Though duty-driven, she is extremely self-conscious, and she's prone to being embarrassed.

HB Blurb: Story: Sakura MMO #2 is the direct sequel to Sakura MMO. Viola’s story continues in the magical land of Asaph! Less than a month prior, Viola was a lawyer bored with her life, who lived in Japan. Her only form of escape was the popular MMO, Asaph Online – but after a shocking turn of events, Viola finds herself transported inside her favorite game! In Asaph, Viola recruits several cute girls to her party, including the devout maid Neve, the easygoing thief Fion, and the righteous knight Eleri. Together, Viola’s party explore Asaph, taking on quests and defeating monsters. Though Viola enjoys her days in Asaph, which are filled with fun and excitement, she can’t help but feel that something is missing. Who summoned her to Asaph, and for what reason? Will she ever be able to return to Japan – and does she really want to? Find out in this exciting sequel full of mysteries, fight scenes, and (most importantly of all) cute girls in skimpy outfits! Viola: Viola is the heroine of the story who has been living in Asaph for little over a month. In Japan, she’s an ordinary human woman called Kotone… but, in Asaph, she’s a powerful dark witch with frightening abilities. She’s notorious throughout Asaph, and strikes fear into the hearts of her enemies. An incorrigible sadist, she enjoys inflicting pain on others – particularly cute girls. She does, however, have a soft side, and she’s very protective of her allies. Neve: Neve is Viola’s loyal maid, who serves Viola dilligently. Neve sees Viola as some kind of savior, and she would give her life to her mistress in a heartbeat. At a glance, Neve appears to be a serious, hard-working woman… and while that is true, she’s deeply possessive and jealous to a fault. She dislikes it when Viola flirts with other girls, and she wishes her mistress would look at her, and only at her…! Neve also has a quick temper, which – coupled with her extensive knowledge of magical spells – can make her a dangerous person to deal with. All the same, she would never, under any circumstances, hurt Viola. She loves her far too much. Fion: Fion is a sly thief who spent many years of her life living on the streets, stealing scraps of food and begging for coins. She has no compunctions about lying – and, in fact, that is how she first met Viola. This crafty girl took Viola in with sob stories about a sad, impoverished childhood, and then proceeded to rob her… but Viola tracked Fion down and punished her accordingly. Now, Fion is a member of Viola’s party. She’s a lot more cheerful and upbeat than Neve and Eleri, which can make her pleasant company – but she adamantly refuses to act in a ladylike manner, or wear sensible clothes. Fion can be a bit of a handful, but she’s well-meaning, and has a heart of gold. Eleri: Eleri is a noble knight who believes deeply in playing fair, and will never try to take advantage of her opponents – often to her own detriment. Though Eleri seems cool and competent, she gets flustered quite easily, and reacts poorly to being teased. She’s quite fun to bully, really – and Viola often derives pleasure from her embarrassed reactions. Though Neve and Fion believe Eleri to be a resident of Asaph, much like them, she actually comes from Japan, much like Viola. Eleri was brought to Asaph in the same way Viola was, and now the pair of them are working together to see if they can return home. Aislinn: Aislinn is a young lady who lives in the city of Lynton. Her family, the Chastains, are one of the two families that governs the city and its people – but Aislinn is woefully unequipped for the task. The young lady’s parents died when she was very young, leaving behind their family home, expensive bits of jewelry, and cripppling debts. Aislinn is unsure of how to support herself and her household, let alone the people, and it hardly helps that her maid, Aoife, coddled her so much in her youth. Aislinn desperately needs somebody to help her manage the burdens heaped upon her shoulders – but could it already be too late? Features: - continue to explore Asaph Online - get to know new companions - available in Chinese

HB Blurb: Story: Sakura MMO #3 is the final part of the Sakura MMO series, which concludes Viola’s adventure. Only a few months ago, Viola was an average woman bored with her life in Japan. Her only method of escape was via the vibrant and colorful MMORPG, Asaph Online. Though Viola poured thousands of hours into Asaph Online, she knew it was little more than a game, and it could never be a suitable substitute for reality. That is, until she found herself transported into the real Asaph! In Asaph, Viola recruits a party of cute girls and decides to fulfil her biggest dream: having a harem! Light-hearted hijinks ensue… but trouble is brewing on the horizon that could spell the end of these peaceful days. The fallen goddess, Iona, has been plotting to bring about an end to Asaph for good – and now Viola must go on a journey across the ocean, alongside her crew, to defeat her. Will Viola emerge triumphant from the skirmish, or will Iona best her? Find out in Sakura MMO #3, the longest instalment of the series. Your choices can save Asaph, or doom it to destruction. Will Viola survive her greatest challenge yet – and which girl will she end up with? It’s all up to you! Viola: Viola is the heroine of the story. In Japan, she was an ordinary woman called Kotone. In Asaph Online, however, she’s a powerful dark witch with access to some of the most formidable spells imaginable. She has a bit of a sadistic side, and she loves toying with cute girls… but she’s brave and loyal, and would rather die than see her allies get injured. Neve: Neve’s is Viola’s loyal, devoted maid, and a member of the maligned darkling race. Neve cares for Viola so deeply she often disregards her own health, and it seems very likely she may one day work herself to death. Though Neve is a polite, softly-spoken young woman, she has a short temper, and won’t hesitate to attack anybody who speaks ill of her mistress. Somewhat neurotic and not entirely stable, Neve has one or two dark secrets that the evil goddess would love to exploit. Fion: Fion is an opportunistic thief girl with a penchant for shiny things. Fion joined Viola’s team after an attempted robbery went awry. Viola caught Fion and punished her accordingly – much to Fion’s chagrin. Though their relationship got off to a rocky start, Fion has grown rather fond of Viola. A cheerful and good-natured young woman, despite her years spent living on the streets, Fion is deft and wily, and a useful ally in any fight. Eleri: Eleri is a cool-tempered, serious knight with a firm sense of duty. Though Eleri acts as the voice of reason in the party, she isn’t infallible. Eleri gets flustered easily, which makes her a prime target for teasing. Like Viola, Eleri is not a native resident of Asaph. Eleri’s real name is Aina, and she used to live in Japan. She met up with Viola quite by chance, and now the two travel together. Though Eleri has grown accustomed to life in Asaph, she’s determined to find her way back home. Iona: The mysterious goddess who resides in the underworld. Iona is one of the oldest goddesses in Asaph. According to Asaphian myth, it was Iona – alongside her husband, Aeron – who created life as we know it. Aeron crafted mankind in his image, while Iona was responsible for creating the darkling race. After their relationship splintered, Iona turned on her husband and tried to kill him. She was soon punished for her folly, however, and she was condemned to the darkest realm of the underworld. Iona has waited for hundreds of years, honing her magical powers in secret, so that she can one day escape from the underworld and destroy Asaph for good.

HB Blurb: After spending a couple of months in the city of Grimoire, Estelle has begun to make a name for herself as an accomplished swordswoman. She, alongside the ditzy elf Felicia, the devious catgirl Tart, and the sweet wolfgirl Rune, has taken on dozens of quests at the local guild, and has completed them all. She's come a long way from her humble beginnings in a small village bakery... but soon, Estelle will have to brave her toughest challenge to date. Deep in the woods, in a withered glade where the grass is dead and nothing grows, a disturbance is lurking. The fierce half-dragon, Saga, once an underling to the feared demon queen who ruled over Lemuria, is beginning to gather forces to avenge her fallen leader. Will Estelle and her party be able to stop Saga - and will Estelle finally be able to settle down with a cute girlfriend or three? Find out in Sakura Knight 3! A young woman with lofty ambitions. She dreams of being a knight like her mother, the famous Cressida, who defeated the wicked demon queen, Gunhild. Estelle wants dearly to be brave and strong, but she's a shy girl with self-esteem issues. Kind-hearted to a fault, she puts others before herself, and often works herself up unnecessarily. She's naïve and a little too trusting, but has a great capacity for love, and is surprisingly good at settling arguments. An elven princess many years older than she initially appears. One day, she will inherit the throne of Gris and become a queen but, for the present, she's testing her skills by accepting quests at Grimoire's guild. A chivalrous woman with a strong sense of justice, Felicia loves nothing more than protecting fair maidens. She's gifted with a sword, has incredible physical prowess, and is swift and decisive during battles. She would be an incredible ally, if she wasn't so liable to get distracted by how attractive she finds all her team mates when they're flushed and sweaty. A wolfgirl of few words, whose grasp on Lemurian is rather shaky. Rune finds it hard to communicate verbally, and often resorts to physical gestures to get her point across. She's very fond of Estelle, and is forever hugging and nuzzling her. Rune doesn't get on well with Tart, who she views (not unreasonably) as a trouble-maker... but, after the events of Sakura Knight 2, the pair have made steps to amend their rocky relationship. Still, Rune can't always resist the urge to get into scraps with Tart. A coy, conniving catgirl who values money above all else, and has no qualms about taking advantage of others. She may seem amoral, but she has her own code of ethics, and she cares deeply about her team members (in her own twisted way). She's particularly fond of Estelle, and takes great pleasure in making her squirm with embarrassment. She's a handful, but she's a valuable ally, with magical skills that shouldn't be sneezed at. As cute as she may seem, she's not one to be taken lightly.

HB Blurb: Taking place after the events of Sakura Knight, Estelle continues her quest to become a famous knight like her mother, Cressida. With her mother's sword retrieved and a party of pretty and capable women to support her, our plucky young heroine tries to make a name for herself in Grimoire, Lemuria's biggest city. Together with the ditzy elf Felicia, the mischievous catgirl Tart, and the affectionate wolfgirl Rune, Estelle takes on quests at Grimoire's guild, fights off hordes of wicked plant and slime monsters, and hones her swordplay. Though her journey got off to a rocky start, things are finally starting to look up for Estelle. Perhaps she'll be able to accomplish her dreams after all! ...It would be a lot easier, though, if Rune and Tart would stop arguing every five seconds. The catgirl and the wolfgirl are constantly at one another's throats, and Estelle and Felicia are unable to placate them, no matter what they do! Then, there's the unusual abundance of monsters in the forest to deal with, not to mention the appearance of a mysterious woman who seems oddly antagonistic towards Estelle. Will Rune and Tart's relationship ever be repaired? What is this strange woman's identity? Will Estelle ever be able to become a real knight... And which of her party members will Estelle pledge her heart to?!

HB Blurb: Yaya, Aiyana, and Koko were childhood friends. Born in the same village, they spent their days in peace, and they vowed to always stay together. This all changed on one fateful night, however, when an army of strange monsters attacked their village. Families were scattered and, in the chaos, Yaya and Aiyana were parted from Koko. Three years later, on Yaya's twenty-first birthday, she and Aiyana vow to find the missing Koko. They leave their village and wander the dense forest that surrounds it, searching for a sign of their friend's whereabouts. After several months, their travels lead them to a mysterious witch, Maia, who claims to be all-powerful. Maia says she can help Yaya and Aiyana, but her help comes at a cost. Before Maia will consider lifting a finger for their sakes, she has Yaya and Aiyana prove their loyalty to her through a series of menial chores and embarrassing tasks. Yaya is prepared to endure any indignity to find Koko (even being used as a human chair) - but can she really trust Maia? Yaya is uncertain... But, as time wears on, she finds herself inexplicably drawn to Maia. Now, why could that be? Yaya is the main character of the story. Her parents were both hunters, and she prides herself on her skills with her spear. Cheerful and optimistic, Yaya is unfailingly certain that she'll find Koko again. She is fiercely protective of Aiyana, and will challenge anybody who dares make her uncomfortable - even a powerful witch like Maia. Aiyana is a shy, softly-spoken girl born to a family of shamans. Her hair is pure white, which is unusual in the village from where she hails. As a result of her strange looks, she was often bullied during her youth. Aiyana has no fighting prowess, and has a weak constitution. She tires easily, and often needs to rely on Yaya, to her embarrassment. She worries frequently about burdening Yaya, but Yaya is quick to reassure her. Unbeknownst to Aiyana, it is because of her steadfast support that Yaya is able to remain so eternally optimistic. Maia is a sneaky, devious witch of an indeterminable age. She speaks rarely of her past, and is shrouded in mystery, which makes her hard to trust. She is exceedingly powerful (or so she claims), and can accomplish truly impressive feats with her magic... But that is only if she feels like it. Maia loves flirting with cute girls more than anything, and she's very hands-on. She and Yaya often butt heads over this, and they can often be found bickering. 

Join Yaya and Aiyana on their journey to find their friend Koko in this lovely visual novel
Small choices influence your ending

HB Blurb: In this Visual Novel, Yaya, Aiyana, and Koko were childhood friends. They were born in the same small village, and they spent their days together peacefully. That all changed, however, when a group of strange monsters attacked their village, and Koko went missing. Three years later, Yaya and Aiyana embark upon a journey to find Koko. During their travels, they’re able to persuade the devious witch Maia to help them, and she uses her magical powers to find Koko’s location. With Maia in tow, Yaya and Aiyana travel to a village presided over by the kind-hearted princess, Arie. Arie is experiencing something of a dilemma herself, as her village has been ailing from the ill effects of a protracted drought. The rivers which run near her village have turned bone dry, the crops dead, and her people are struggling to make ends meet. Arie agrees to help Yaya and Aiyana search for Koko, but only if Maia will agree to use her magical powers to right the drought which has ruined her village. While Maia prepares for this ceremony, Yaya grows close to Arie. Feelings between them begin to develop – but if Yaya is to stay by Arie’s side, she’ll have to abandon her quest to find Koko. Then, there’s Arie’s high priestess to worry about, whose behavior is awfully suspicious. What will Yaya do now?! Yaya is the protagonist of this tale. She was trained to be a hunter by her parents, and she’s good at hunting with her trusty spear. Yaya is a cheerful, energetic young woman who always looks on the bright side of life. She’s very protective of her childhood friend, Aiyana, and she dedicates herself to cheering Aiyana up. Though a good-natured woman, Yaya has something of a short temper, and often comes to blows with Maia – particularly when Maia tries to tease her. Aiyana is an anxious, awkward girl born into a family of shamans. Though those with white hair are believed to possess immense magical powers, Aiyana is quite mundane, and has no special abilities to speak of. That did not stop her from being bullied and mistrusted while growing up, however. Aiyana is a delicate young woman with little in the way of stamina. She feels faint at the sight of blood, and can’t stand the thought of hunting. She often relies on Yaya to fight her battles, which leads to her feeling like a dead weight, despite Yaya’s constant reassurances. Maia is a mischievous witch whose age is something of a mystery. She dislikes speaking about herself, but she adores ferreting out other people’s secrets, then teasing them relentlessly. Maia is very gifted with magic, to such a degree she can commune with the spirits, alter the weather, and flip cute girls’ skirts up with errant gusts of air (to Yaya’s chagrin). Maia is no ordinary human, but a witch, and – as such – her sense of propriety is somewhat skewed. She has no regard to personal space, and gets a sadistic kick out of making cute girls squirm. Yaya is her favorite target. Arie is the young, inexperienced princess of the village where Yaya, Aiyana, and Maia find themselves in their search for Koko. She appears graceful and dignified, but gets flustered easily, and often worries about making a good impression upon others. Arie is highly respected among her people, but she has no genuine friends. Her subjects revere her too much to consent to using her first name, and insist upon calling her ‘your highness’. Arie tries to act as though this does not bother her, but deep down, she desperately desires a friend. Imala is Arie’s high priestess, and her chief advisor. Older than she appears, and significantly more experienced than Arie, Imala is well-poised to give sage advice whenever it is needed. Imala possesses a good deal of magical prowess, but how powerful she is remains a mystery. Imala is rarely seen without a smile, but there’s something shadowy lurking beneath it.

HB Blurb: Yaya, Aiyana, and Koko were childhood friends. Born in the same small village, they spent their days together, until their home was attacked by a multitude of strange, slimy creatures. After that night, Koko vanished into thin air, leaving Yaya and Aiyana alone. Three years later, Yaya and Aiyana set out to search Koko. They enlist the help of a mischievous witch, Maia, who helps them locate their missing friend with the use of her magic. After venturing across the land, and meeting several interesting people – including a sheltered princess, Arie, and her eerie priestess, Imala – Yaya and Aiyana are eventually able to reunite with Koko, but there is a catch. They might have found their childhood friend, but she has no intention of returning to her old village with them. She’s already in an established relationship with the fast-talking merchant Mika, and she seems more than content with her lot in life. A threat looms, meanwhile, as more of the strange, sticky creatures which attacked Yaya’s village seem poised to launch further indiscriminate assaults across the land. Now that Yaya knows who is behind these attacks, she’s determined to stop them – but will her determination be enough? Yaya is the main character of the story. Trained as a hunter by her parents, she’s skilled with a spear, and has fast reflexes. Yaya is generally cheerful, and has an easygoing outlook on life. She’s fiercely protective of Aiyana, however, and can become uncharacteristically grumpy when she perceives that her friend is being threatened. She doesn’t get along particularly well with Maia, and the two are always butting heads. Aiyana is a quiet, anxious girl who has difficulties speaking her mind and expressing her true feelings. Though raised by a family of shamans, Aiyana believes herself to be devoid of magical power. She has no faith in her own abilities, and constantly belittles herself, to Yaya’s chagrin. She wants nothing more than for Aiyana to be more self-confident, but her support seems to have little effect. Maia is a wily witch who never talks about her real age, nor her past. She’s maddeningly vague when it comes to sharing her own personal details, but she’s gifted at unearthing other people’s secrets, then using them to her advantage. Maia loves nothing more than cute girls, and she flirts with almost any attractive woman she meets. This causes friction between herself and Yaya, who doesn’t appreciate Maia’s constant advances. Maia might be a handful, but her magical abilities are nothing to sneeze at, and she’s a very useful ally. Koko is Yaya and Aiyana’s childhood friend. She’s a kind, considerate girl who cares a good deal for her friends, and she’s sensitive about the feelings of others. Koko is gifted at cooking and cleaning, but she’s similarly skilled with a bow and arrow. Gentle though she is, she has no hesitation when it comes to hunting, and her skills might even rival those of Yaya’s. She has something of a stubborn streak despite her sweet face, and she used to act as amother figure to Yaya, chastising her whenever she made a nuisance of herself. Mika is a traveling merchant who roams the land selling her wares. Talkative and cheery, she’s rarely seen without a wide smile upon her face, and nothing seems to perturb her. Mika is in a dedicated relationship with Koko, whom she dotes upon. She often calls Koko silly pet names, such as ‘my little cocoa bean’ – a fact which Koko finds incredibly embarrassing. She has a bit of a past with Maia, who seems to regard her with mild disdain. Mika, meanwhile, is impervious to this, and loudly proclaims that she and Maia are the best of friends.

HB Blurb: Takagi Haru is a normal university student, with a somewhat abnormal passion for the stars. A member of his university's astronomy club, alongside his friendly upper-classman, Hiyori, Haru was content to watch the stars from afar... That is, until one night, when a strange girl in a skintight bodysuit lands on top of him. This girl claims to be an alien princess called Ena, on the run from her home planet, Corval, owing to the strict expectations placed upon her by her royal parents. Ena, a huge fan of Earth, and of earthling culture in general, is over the moon when she meets Haru. She's convinced that their abrupt meeting was written in the stars, and claims herself as Haru's future bride. Ena's determined to make Haru fall in love with her, so she can marry him and live out the rest of her days on Earth - but Hiyori has feelings for Haru, too, and she also ends up confessing to him. What will Haru do, now he has two pretty girls vying for his attention, and a fugitive alien princess living in his apartment? He doesn't know, but one thing is certain: his life will never be the same again! Ena is an alien princess who comes from the planet Corval, located in the far away Ankh Galaxy. Though Ena was born and raised in a palace, she's no stickler for manners, and she has little regard for personal space. Cheerful, energetic, and incredibly stubborn, Ena is determined to make Haru fall in love with her, no matter the cost. Hiyori is a sweet, gentle girl one year older than Haru, who acts as the president of the university's astronomy club. Hiyori, like Haru, is obsessed with space - but, unlike Haru, she's obsessed with it to such a degree she thinks she might be an alien herself. Hiyori used to be bullied in high school for her delusions, and didn't have many friends. As such, she deeply values her relationship with Haru, and she can be rather clingy.
