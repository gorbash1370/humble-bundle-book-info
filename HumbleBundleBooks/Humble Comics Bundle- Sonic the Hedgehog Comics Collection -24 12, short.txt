HB Blurb: A stormy night. A plane crash. A deserted island—or so it seems. Sonic and Tails find themselves castaways, surrounded by robots hardwired to target them! That's no island—it's the weathered hulk of the Death Egg, and it's crawling with scrapped, rusted, and malfunctioning Badniks! Each and every one of them was created by Eggman to destroy that meddlesome hedgehog, but the mad doctor left other creations as well. Lethal, personal, familiar creations. What other secrets does the crumbling battle station hold? Are all of Eggman's monsters doomed to follow their programming, or can they step out of their maker's shadow? And where can a hungry ’hog get a chili dog around here? Writer Daniel Barnes (The Black Mage, Aggretsuko) presents a nail-biting new Sonic adventure, full of fears and gears, with shadowy, shocking art by IDW Sonic veteran Jack Lawrence (Transformers: Wreckers—Tread & Circuits).
