HB Blurb: The award-winning Cypher System is the critically acclaimed game engine that powers any campaign in any genre. Lauded for its elegance, ease of use, flexibility, and narrative focus, the Cypher System unleashes the creativity of GMs and players with intuitive character creation, fast-paced gameplay, and a uniquely GM-friendly design. The Cypher System is easy for beginners to learn, but offers all the depth, nuance, and complexity you want. Some people call it a “rules-light” system, but it has the power and sophistication of games that are much more mechanically heavy—and yet it is substantially more flexible. GMs find the game easy to prep for and easy to run—it frees up the GM’s attention, in prep and at the game table, to focus on cool, creative ideas rather than numbers, mechanics, and “crunch.” The Cypher System Rulebook provides everything you need to run virtually any game—if you can imagine it, the Cypher System makes it easy. It's supported by a line of hefty genre books that dig deeply into specific genres, and a number of fascinating and unique campaign settings and other titles.

HB Blurb: Welcome to the Cretaceous. Our ancestors won’t climb down from the trees for another 66 million years, but here we are now. Time travel seemed like a good idea. Exploring the ancient world. Building. Creating an entire society here in the jungles of our primordial Earth. Until those SATI guys messed it all up and left us stranded. We’ve got gear. We’ve got guns. We’ve even bioengineered a few dinos to our liking. And that’s good, because we’ll need it all to survive. History says there’s an asteroid headed our way, and there’s no one left alive who knows how to get back to the future.

Published Date:

HB Blurb: It’s the abandoned corridor, the flickering light never quite reaching the deeper shadows. It’s that cry in the distance—a child’s wail, or some weird animal bleating? It’s the gentle breath on the neck, or that slithering motion just past the edge of the light. It’s horror, and whether it’s a terrifying one-shot adventure, an entire campaign fighting against the darkness, or an edge of tension added to a more conventional adventure, it makes for great roleplaying experiences. Build an entire campaign battling Lovecraftian cults or surviving the zombie apocalypse. Run one-shots that pit the players against masked slashers, crawling xenomorphs, or sinister spirits. Or just get the most fun out of your lich queen and her minions at the lowest depths of your dungeon. No matter how you use horror at your table, this 224-page genre book gives you all the tools you need to create hair-raising game sessions and nail-biting campaigns.

Published Date:

HB Blurb: What fantasy worlds inspire you? The classic high fantasy of Tolkien, Zelazny, or Jordan? Modern fantasy like the Harry Potter series, The Dresden Files, or Buffy the Vampire Slayer? Paranormal romance? The whimsy of settings like Discworld or The Dark Crystal? Wuxia, swords and sorcery, or gritty, low-magic settings? Fantasy—tales of heroes, monsters, and magic—is arguably the oldest genre of human fiction. It’s also the genre that first inspired us to step into imaginary worlds through roleplaying games, and it remains the most popular type of RPG setting. Godforsaken takes the Cypher System on a deep dive into the infinite variety of fantasy realms, with rules, character options, gear, and a complete, ready-to-use setting that makes the most of the fantasy genre. Whatever fantasy setting you envision, the Cypher System can take you there!

HB Blurb: Jack climbing the beanstalk. The little mermaid finding her voice. Alice struggling with the madness of a place unruled by the laws of reality. The queen. The child. The woodsman. The knight. When you think about fairy tales, who do you become? Where does your imagination take you? Fairy tales tap into myth and archetype, exploring the fundamental nature of the mind and of human experience. They’re filled with magic that’s big, bold, unexpected, and wondrous—and characters who, despite humble roots or broken foundations, achieve feats just as grand. Run one-shots based on traditional stories or those of your own devising. Or build entire campaigns that take the fairy tale concept in whole new directions.

Whatever your apocalypse, Rust and Redemption is your tool for building it into a vivid, compelling Cypher System campaign.

After the Nightfall is an adventure for the Gods of the Fall setting for the Cypher System.

HB Blurb: The world on which you are marooned is savage and brutal. The scant supplies in your ruined lifeboat offer little aid, and even fewer clues to who you are or where you came from. But you’re not alone on this strange planet—unknown forces, for unknown reasons, are hunting you. There’s a way off, but finding it will mean discovering and facing these forces—and your own identity. Inspired by the likes of the Ancillary Justice series, Leviathan Wakes, and Lost, Castaway is a hard-charging sci-fi adventure for the Cypher System that can be played with a strong personal horror theme or with more focus on exploration and discovery.

She’s a master of social and media manipulation, but whether it’s targeting the East Coast with her solar cannon or freezing the mayor’s family in liquid nitrogen, she’s followed through on her myriad extortion schemes often enough—and horribly enough—to prove they’re not hollow threats. So when her Dread Corps commandos assault the New York Museum of Art to steal a 3,000-year-old mummy, it’s up to your superhero team to stop her. But is the mummy, with its rumored mystical properties, really what Doctor Dread wants—or does she have something even bigger in mind? A low-prep Instant Adventure. Includes pregenerated superheroes.

HB Blurb: In 2017, Oumuamua made headlines as the first interstellar object ever detected passing through our solar system. Everyone remembers that. A web search will tell you all about it. So why doesn’t anyone remember Nibiru? How it curved out of the night, its trajectory changing so rapidly that scientists could barely track it. How its arc altered, day by day, inexorably toward our own. How the skies blazed when it struck the Earth. How the seas boiled, and the cities burned. Except the cities still stand, the sky is unburnt, and only an unlucky few of us have nightmares about Nibiru. Maybe we’re losing our minds. Sharing a delusion. And that newfound ability—to turn invisible, to read thoughts, to levitate—is just another shared delusion. But if so, why are we being hunted down? The Origin is a gritty and mysterious setting in which characters master emerging superpowers as they face nefarious groups, superpowered opponents, and dark forces somehow connected to memories of a world that met a different fate.

HB Blurb: In the Cypher System, exploration and risk are everything. Players earn experience points not for killing monsters, but for making discoveries and facing unexpected challenges. You might rack up your XP between sessions, but most commonly you receive experience points during play, when events take an unexpected turn or you make a remarkable discovery. And XPs are useful in both the short- and long-term: spend 1 XP to reroll for yourself (or a friend), or save them up for character advancement! The beautiful new Cypher System XP Deck gives you a set of tangible tokens to represent experience points. Each of the 30 cards in this striking deck features unique art from across the breadth of the Cypher System. It’s a simple but useful tool at the game table.

HB Blurb: Breathe life into an infinite variety of NPCs—for any campaign! Putting together a new adventure or campaign? GMing an impromptu encounter? Got a game session that’s gone in an entirely unexpected direction? In almost any gamemastering situation, one of the greatest challenges is coming up with nonplayer characters (NPCs) that are interesting, unique, and fleshed out—particularly when time is short. The 100-card NPC Deck helps you breathe life into your NPCs with details of their appearance, personality, abilities, and possessions—even their names. Just create a role to fill—shopkeeper, mobster, duke’s seneschal, street urchin, ship captain—and assign the NPC a level. Then use this deck to fill in details and inspire you in any of several ways. Best of all, the NPC Deck is setting-neutral—even game-system-neutral! The details provided will work in virtually any campaign setting.

Published Date: 
---
HB Blurb: GM intrusions are part of what makes the Cypher System so fluid, fast-paced, and narrative-focused—and a real joy to GM! A good GM intrusion introduces an unexpected factor that spices up a scene, creates a turning point in an adventure, or throws a little wrench into the PCs’ best-laid plans. Sometimes GMs prepare them in advance, but often they occur spontaneously, where the GM sees a cool opportunity or a d20 roll results in that dreaded “1.” But coming up with just the right intrusion on the fly can sometimes strain even the best GM’s creativity. At the table, or in prep, it helps to have a little inspiration! The GM Intrusion Deck gives you 300 intrusion ideas on 100 cards. Each card offers a combat intrusion, a social intrusion, and an intrusion for miscellaneous situations. Need an intrusion on the fly, or some inspiration when planning your game? Just draw a card. Or draw two or three, and pick the one you like—or just use them to inspire some other great idea. Save time and effort, and free your creativity with the GM Intrusion Deck!

With mere hours to pull off the caper, can you and your associates uncover the truth—and make it off Miracle IV alive?

HB Blurb: It is 1921. Three young men have disappeared from a rural village in Devon. Authorities are called in, but the villagers have their own theory: a local myth tells of a vampire that, every few decades, steals away three young people. Is there any truth to the myth, or is something more mundane at work? And what does it all have to do with Creston Grange, the local manor house, now standing derelict and rumored to be one of the most haunted sites in England? This 32-page adventure was run in official 2022 Cypher System events at Gen Con and Gamehole Con, and was specifically designed to give the GM a range of encounters that allow the adventure to play out differently each time it’s run. It’s a great stand-alone scenario, or launch point of an ongoing horror campaign, for new or experienced Cypher System players. Six pre-generated characters are included, so you have everything you need to play!

But in a multiverse stretching across epochs, the number of previously uncatalogued planes is vast. The Planebreaker races through all of them, in time, and the Path that trails behind it creates a route that links them all. Path of the Planebreaker introduces this enigmatic interplanar object that unlocks access to the planes for characters of all tiers, allowing you to inject planar exploration into any campaign, or build an entire new campaign around the Planebreaker, its fascinating city of Timeborne, and the infinite astonishing worlds they visit.

HB Blurb: Planar natives, multiverse explorers, and those touched by mysterious forces leaking through from the planes: these characters are shaped by backgrounds and experiences unlike those found in more conventional environs. From a Warrior who Strikes With an Amethyst Fist, channelling power through a psionically resonant prosthetic, to a traveller character with a mysterious cosmic map imprinted on their skin, to a character with the Limbo Touched ability, who can change objects at will—characters with ties to the planes are just a bit different.

HB Blurb: Perhaps you were born and raised here; perhaps you have recently arrived. Either way, you now walk the streets of Ptolus, that great port city beneath the towering, mysterious Spire. You know a few things about this place—it is not without a reputation, to say the least. To call Ptolus a dynamic, vibrant city with a strange and varied identity is to greatly undersell it. Only now are explorers discovering how ancient the city really is, unearthing details of its long and twisting story. And Ptolus is where that strange breed that calls itself “delvers” congregates. It’s a place where people are as concerned with what lies below the ground as they are with what’s above. This is like no place else in the world. A Player’s Guide to Ptolus is an accessible and portable option for players who want quick access to myriad details of the city.

HB Blurb: The Cult of the Ebon Hand, an evil group that worships deformity and mutation, has been rooted out and destroyed. Now, in Ptolus, even bearing a symbol of the Ebon Hand is a crime. There may be other chaos cults operating in the city, but the Ebon Hand, one of the worst, has been closed down. Or so it was thought. Echoes of transformative chaos have been leaching into the Guildsman District. Among the effects is the appearance of the Reborn, a gang of long-dead criminals now brought back to a twisted form of life. The Reborn are settling old grudges by attacking prominent citizens of Ptolus. Ending their depredations—and the reemerging cult itself—will take the PCs deep into the shadowed depths of Ghul’s Labyrinth and to the borders of insanity itself.

As the Runeblood Blessing becomes increasingly common, a mysterious sickness spreads through the city, and a crime wave threatens to lead to all-out war between Ptolus’s criminal organizations.

And how does all of this connect to the gloomy demirealm called the Shadow of Ptolus?

HB Blurb: In the murky recesses of time, a powerful and benevolent cleric set upon a well-intentioned plan. In those days, evil was on the decline, and the forces of darkness had been routed in almost every field of battle. Danar Rotansin sought to finalize this defeat by gathering evil artifacts, objects of dark power, trapped essences of vanquished fiends, demonic relics, and even the last vestiges of particularly horrible diseases. He imprisoned these “banes” in a deep and powerful network of vaults, believing that to destroy them would release their evil back into the world. But evil has its ways of subverting even the best among us, and Danar’s Rotansin’s path led toward darker destinies. His vaults, however, still remain deep beneath Ptolus. And now they are once again opened.

HB Blurb: That house on the outskirts of town, sitting empty behind a crumbling wall. The one people whisper about. The one that has gone unlived in for years. Sometimes a few hearty souls creep in, it is said, to see what treasures or secrets they can find. Most find nothing—just an empty old house. Some return shaken. A few don’t return at all. What happens to a house when it sits alone for so many long years? What jealousies and hatreds does it quietly nurture? What whispers echo through its empty hallways? What waits, crouched within its dark rooms, hungering for the return of life? The Darkest House is an mega-adventure that takes you into a unique realm of horror. It’s made for the game you’re playing right now, to be integrated into your campaign regardless of the setting or game system. And it's uniquely optimized for a rich, powerful experience that's immersive for the players and easy on the GM. This unique product format is unlike any existing RPG product. The Darkest House app is a digital product designed for the needs of a game being run and played online—and built to take maximum advantage of that mode of play. Think of it like an RPG book that’s been reimagined from the ground up for the online environment, with pages formatted for your screen, easily-sharable resources, no page-flipping, intuitive navigation, and additional features that don’t just make online gaming easier—they take advantage of its unique nature to deliver a better RPG experience. Your players may find the Darkest House a daunting challenge, but you’ll find it amazingly easy to GM. The Darkest House is fully compatible with all virtual tabletops, as well as videoconferencing, Discord or Slack play, or any other platform gamers commonly use for online TTRPG games. You can use the app for face-to-face play—in fact, it's great for that, too—but the GM will need a computer with internet access.

HB Blurb: Tackle Mature Content with Confidence! From fending off bloodthirsty pirates to delving into dank caverns, roleplaying games allow you to explore and experience things you probably don’t want to face in real life—or to approach topics from the perspective of characters who may be very different than your actual self. This shared experience is intended to be fun for all involved, but RPGs can put characters in life-or-death crises, intense emotional situations, or traumatic environments. Whether it’s body horror in a scary game, violence against children or animals in a fantasy world, flirty, romantic, or sexual relationships in any setting—or numerous other challenging scenarios—the line between fun and awkward, difficult, or downright unpleasant can be difficult to identify, and varies dramatically from player to player. Consent in Gaming gives you the strategies you need to make sure everyone at the table has a great experience, even when the game goes in a challenging direction.
