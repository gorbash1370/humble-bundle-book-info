HB Blurb: "Métal Hurlant" magazine was created in Paris in 1974 by Moebius, Druillet and Dionnet, the founding fathers of Les HumanoÃ¯des Associés. This movement soon revolutionized the medium and inspired countless writers, artists and filmmakers the world over. Versions in various languages flourished everywhere, including in the States with "Heavy Metal." The French version was eventually shut down in 1987. But in 2002, Humanoids relaunched a limited publication of a 13-issue anthology, with one main goal: establishing a creative bridge between the US and Europe.
Includes stories written and illustrated by comic book stars Geoff Johns, Kurt Busiek, Guy Davis, and Jerome Opena, among many others.

As the Metabaron launches a counter-offensive, the Empire will send its most feared soldiers to defend the power they have amassed, even to the doors of the Metabunker itself. To make matters even more dire, the Metabaron’s less than honorable son seeks to usurp the power of the father who abandoned him. Can the Metabaron withstand the many challenges before him and save the universe once more?

HB Blurb: A collection of stories featuring an unstoppable army and an indomitable hero, all set amid the backdrop of barbaric and medieval lands. PUBLICATION IN 3 VOLUMES - COMPLETED SERIES. Jean-Pierre Dionnet, one of the founders of Metal Hurlant, started a new genre in comics when he collaborated with artist Jean-Claude Gal (Diosamante) in the late 1970s: Heroic Fantasy. It shortly thereafter gained the favor of the public and has since grown immensely. This is the occasion for all lovers of the genre to return to its roots. Witness, with the help of Gal's intricate style, the devastating effects of war as you follow an army's forward progress, and then join Arn's bloody quest for revenge.

Criminagent Milo Deckman witnesses the murder of a woman in the street. At the morgue, retinal identification indicates not one, but two identities, each with her own husband.
