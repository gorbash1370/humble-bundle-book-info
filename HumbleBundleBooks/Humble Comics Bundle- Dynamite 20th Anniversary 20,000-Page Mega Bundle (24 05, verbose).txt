HB Blurb: “Know also, O prince, that in the selfsame days that the Cimmerian did stalk the Hyborian Kingdoms, one of the few swords worthy to cross with his was that of Red Sonja, warrior-woman out of majestic Hyrkania. Forced to flee her homeland because she spurned the advances of a king and slew him instead, she rode west across the Turanian steppes and into the shadowed mists of legendry.”---The Nemedian ChroniclesShe lived in a savage world in an uncivilized age – a world ruled by men and governed by the sword. They called her Red Sonja – for her flame-red hair, and for the smoldering fire of her pride which gave her sword-arm a strength that few men could match, and none had ever defeated.This is a must-have collection of never-before reprinted material. Containing the tales from Red Sonja 0-6, plus commentary by Michael Avon Oeming and Mike Carey!

HB Blurb: For years, the raven-haired heroine Vampirella has hunted the world's supernatural threats, all the while fighting back her own bloodthirsty nature. After a night out in Boston leads to particularly brutal violence, she seeks comfort in her Brownstone home... but discovers the most unexpected surprise of all. Angels have been sent to her by God - and they come asking for help! Enter Janus, a former soldier in the legion of Heaven, who skirts the line between the damned and divine. Only a fallen angel can navigate Vampirella through the seedy, demon-run underworld, where she hopes to find the source of an addictive, body-altering drug derived from archangel blood. Will Vampirella's mission redeem her... or will she uncover secrets so shocking that their discovery will damn her forever?

HB Blurb: Every living creature on Earth has been devolved - the evolutionary clock turned back, reverting all life to odd mutations and prehistoric incarnations. The cities of man are little more than bloody territories ruthlessly dominated by tribal Neanderthals ruling from the backs of mammoths, packs of saber-toothed tigers, and giant man-eating insects. Raja, one of the few remaining ""Still Sapien"" humans, heads to San Francisco to find the antidote for the world-changing DVO-8 viral agent. But to cross the wasteland, she'll have to convince the last pocket of humanity to join her quest... and survive the Nazi hillbillies that rule them through fear!
Rick Remender, the acclaimed writer of Black Science, Low, and Deadly Class, unleashes a high-octane dystopian masterpiece on the world, featuring the brilliant artistry of Jonathan Wayshak!

HB Blurb: Cody Pomeray had a gift for looking inside a person's soul with just a glance. This ability served him well, as the crook blew through the early 1980s, finding marks and picking them clean. But one fateful night, he targeted the wrong man... and was sentenced to the most savage prison in California. Pomeray would have been beaten to death on his first day if not for the intervention of Barnaby Creed, the most powerful crime lord in the Southland. Now five years later, Pomeray's out on parole, robbed of his special ability, and tasked with doing Creed "a little favor." He has no idea he's just stepped into a long con, and this time... he's the mark. Includes Duane Swierczynski's first issue script as a bonus feature!

HB Blurb: Peter V. Brett, New York Times bestselling author of The Demon Cycle, lovingly pays homage to the iconic fantasy heroine in a tale that recaptures the tone of Robert E. Howard's barbarian epics. An encounter with a devil leaves Red Sonja, the legendary swordswoman, bereft of her signature chainmail and fleeing murder charges, but a change of clothes and venue aren't enough to escape the guilt in her heart. Penniless and under pursuit, she has no choice but to accept a dangerous mercenary job: to search for the tomb of an ancient warrior queen. But the spirit of Queen Gheta lives on: a fierce and unnatural combatant who may be the only creature in history capable of defeating Sonja. Meanwhile, the demonic entity Bhamothes wreaks havoc in her homeland of Hyrkania and only the forgiveness of a murdered boy can end its killing spree!

HB Blurb: Dr. Herbert West, The Reanimator, returns! Setting up shop in New Orleans, the brilliant Dr. West continues his life's work: the revival of the dead by purely chemical means. To accomplish this task, he recruits Susan Greene, a young and wide-eyed pharmacologist fascinated by his macabre experiments. Initially unfazed by West's unorthodox practices (including how he funds his research - by selling zombie brain fluid as a narcotic), Susan may regret her scientific curiosity as sinister forces - those aligned with Elder Gods and Haitian Voodoo - begin to align against the Reanimator. Dynamite Entertainment proudly resurrects H.P Lovecraft's notorious mad scientist in a fear-fraught tale of Cthulhu tentacle terror and backwater Louisianan superstition! Bonus features include a thorough "History of The Reanimator" prose introduction by writer Keith Davidsen, an insightful and meticulously researched appendix of Lovecraftian references and creator commentary, never-before-seen design illustrations from artist Randy Valiente, and a complete cover gallery featuring the work of Francesco Francavilla, Jae Lee, Andrew Mangum, Nacho Tenorio, and Tim Seeley.
