HB Blurb: For a mother regaining her sexual self, it’s less about learning the latest and greatest blow job technique and more about figuring out how to make a sexual relationship work when the batteries from your vibrator are now powering your baby monitor and the last orgasm you had was when your baby slept four hours in a row.Motherhood undoubtedly affects our sex lives, but with little opportunity to explore the new changes in our bodies and sexual beings, like many mothers we focus on making sure our kids have perfectly mashed organic bananas and fair-trade hemp organic diapers. And while their tummies and asses are pesticide-free, we’re wishing someone cared about ours (or at least our asses) just as much.This guide gives moms everywhere permission to exchange their mommy jeans for something just a bit more, um . . . flattering. Self-proclaimed Mominatrix and author of the popular sex column of the same name, Kristen Chase proves that there is more to motherhood than diapers and timeouts. Good moms can be sexy mamas with just a little mominatrix training!
