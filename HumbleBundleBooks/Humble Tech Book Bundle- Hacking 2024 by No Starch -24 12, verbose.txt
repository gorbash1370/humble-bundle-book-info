HB Blurb: Nearly every enterprise uses an Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agent to monitor the devices on their network for signs of an attack. But that doesn’t mean security defenders grasp how these systems actually work. This book demystifies EDR, taking you on a deep dive into how EDRs detect adversary activity. Chapter by chapter, you’ll learn that EDR is not a magical black box—it’s just a complex software application built around a few easy-to-understand components.
The author uses his years of experience as a red team operator to investigate each of the most common sensor components, discussing their purpose, explaining their implementation, and showing the ways they collect various data points from the Microsoft operating system. In addition to covering the theory behind designing an effective EDR, each chapter also reveals documented evasion strategies for bypassing EDRs that red teamers can use in their engagements.

HB Blurb: We’re all aware of Stuxnet, ShadowHammer, Sunburst, and similar attacks that use evasion to remain hidden while defending themselves from detection and analysis. Because advanced threats like these can adapt and, in some cases, self-destruct to evade detection, even the most seasoned investigators can use a little help with analysis now and then. Evasive Malware will introduce you to the evasion techniques used by today’s malicious software and show you how to defeat them.
Following a crash course on using static and dynamic code analysis to uncover malware’s true intentions, you’ll learn how malware weaponizes context awareness to detect and skirt virtual machines and sandboxes, plus the various tricks it uses to thwart analysis tools. You’ll explore the world of anti-reversing, from anti-disassembly methods and debugging interference to covert code execution and misdirection tactics. You’ll also delve into defense evasion, from process injection and rootkits to fileless malware. Finally, you’ll dissect encoding, encryption, and the complexities of malware obfuscators and packers to uncover the evil within.
You’ll learn how malware:

Abuses legitimate components of Windows, like the Windows API and LOLBins, to run undetected
Uses environmental quirks and context awareness, like CPU timing and hypervisor enumeration, to detect attempts at analysis
Bypasses network and endpoint defenses using passive circumvention techniques, like obfuscation and mutation, and active techniques, like unhooking and tampering
Detects debuggers and circumvents dynamic and static code analysis

You’ll also find tips for building a malware analysis lab and tuning it to better counter anti-analysis techniques in malware. Whether you’re a frontline defender, a forensic analyst, a detection engineer, or a researcher, Evasive Malware will arm you with the knowledge and skills you need to outmaneuver the stealthiest of today’s cyber adversaries.

HB Blurb: Ethical Hacking is a crash course in modern hacking techniques. It’s already being used to prepare the next generation of offensive security experts. In its many hands-on labs, you’ll explore crucial skills for any aspiring penetration tester, security researcher, or malware analyst.
You’ll begin with the basics: capturing a victim’s network traffic with an ARP spoofing attack and then viewing it in Wireshark. From there, you’ll deploy reverse shells that let you remotely run commands on a victim’s computer, encrypt files by writing your own ransomware in Python, and fake emails like the ones used in phishing attacks. In advanced chapters, you’ll learn how to fuzz for new vulnerabilities, craft trojans and rootkits, exploit websites with SQL injection, and escalate your privileges to extract credentials, which you’ll use to traverse a private network.
You’ll work with a wide range of professional penetration testing tools—and learn to write your own tools in Python—as you practice tasks like:

Deploying the Metasploit framework’s reverse shells and embedding them in innocent-seeming files
Capturing passwords in a corporate Windows network using Mimikatz
Scanning (almost) every device on the internet to find potential victims
Installing Linux rootkits that modify a victim’s operating system
Performing advanced Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks that execute sophisticated JavaScript payloads

Along the way, you’ll gain a foundation in the relevant computing technologies. Discover how advanced fuzzers work behind the scenes, learn how internet traffic gets encrypted, explore the inner mechanisms of nation-state malware like Drovorub, and much more.
Developed with feedback from cybersecurity students, Ethical Hacking addresses contemporary issues in the field not often covered in other books and will prepare you for a career in penetration testing. Most importantly, you’ll be able to think like an ethical hacker: someone who can carefully analyze systems and creatively gain access to them.

HB Blurb: If you’re getting started along the exciting path of hacking, cybersecurity, and pentesting, Linux Basics for Hackers is an excellent first step. Using Kali Linux, an advanced penetration testing distribution of Linux, you’ll learn the basics of using the Linux operating system and acquire the tools and techniques you’ll need to take control of a Linux environment.
First, you’ll learn how to install Kali on a virtual machine and get an introduction to basic Linux concepts. Next, you’ll tackle broader Linux topics like manipulating text, controlling file and directory permissions, and managing user environment variables. You’ll then focus in on foundational hacking concepts like security and anonymity and learn scripting skills with bash and Python. Practical tutorials and exercises throughout will reinforce and test your skills as you learn how to:

Cover your tracks by changing your network information and manipulating the rsyslog logging utility
Write a tool to scan for network connections, and connect and listen to wireless networks
Keep your internet activity stealthy using Tor, proxy servers, VPNs, and encrypted email
Write a bash script to scan open ports for potential targets
Use and abuse services like MySQL, Apache web server, and OpenSSH
Build your own hacking tools, such as a remote video spy camera and a password cracker

HB Blurb: Modern web applications are built on a tangle of technologies that have been developed over time and then haphazardly pieced together. Every piece of the web application stack, from HTTP requests to browser-side scripts, comes with important yet subtle security consequences. To keep users safe, it is essential for developers to confidently navigate this landscape.
In The Tangled Web, Michal Zalewski, one of the world’s top browser security experts, offers a compelling narrative that explains exactly how browsers work and why they’re fundamentally insecure. Rather than dispense simplistic advice on vulnerabilities, Zalewski examines the entire browser security model, revealing weak points and providing crucial information for shoring up web application security. You’ll learn how to:

Perform common but surprisingly complex tasks such as URL parsing and HTML sanitization
Use modern security features like Strict Transport Security, Content Security Policy, and Cross-Origin Resource Sharing
Leverage many variants of the same-origin policy to safely compartmentalize complex web applications and protect user credentials in case of XSS bugs
Build mashups and embed gadgets without getting stung by the tricky frame navigation policy
Embed or host user-supplied content without running into the trap of content sniffing

For quick reference, “Security Engineering Cheat Sheets” at the end of each chapter offer ready solutions to problems you’re most likely to encounter. With coverage extending as far as planned HTML5 features, The Tangled Web will help you create secure web applications that stand the test of time.
