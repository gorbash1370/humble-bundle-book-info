HB Blurb: This book will show how generative technology works and the drivers. It will also look at the applications – showing what various startupsand large companies are doing in the space.There will also be a look at the challenges and risk factors. During the past decade, companies have spent billions on AI. But the focus has been on applying the technology to predictions – which is known as analytical AI. It can mean that you receive TikTok videos that you cannot resist. Or analytical AI can fend against spam or fraud or forecast when a package will be delivered. While such things are beneficial, there is much more to AI. The next megatrend will be leveraging the technology to be creative. For example, you could take a book and an AI model will turn it into a movie – at very little cost. This is all part of generative AI. It’s still in the nascent stages but it is progressing quickly. Generative AI can already create engaging blog posts, social media messages, beautiful artwork and compelling videos. The potential for this technology is enormous. It will be useful for many categories like sales, marketing, legal, product design, code generation, and even pharmaceutical creation.What You Will LearnThe importance of understanding generative AIThe fundamentals of the technology, like the foundation and diffusion modelsHow generative AI apps workHow generative AI will impact various categories like the law, marketing/sales, gaming, product development, and code generation.The risks, downsides and challenges.Who This Book is ForProfessionals that do not have a technical background. Rather, the audience will be mostly those in Corporate America (such as managers) as well as people in tech startups, who will need an understanding of generative AI to evaluate the solutions.

It gives the readers the motivations and background of the relevant research. In Part I, basic knowledges of machine and deep learning are introduced, which provide the foundation for the readers irrespective of their background.In Part II, to verify the effectiveness of the AI methods, the key procedure of the typical AI-aided SHM applications (classification, localization, and segmentation) is explored, including vision data collection, data pre-processing,transfer learning-based training mechanism, evaluation, and analysis.In Part III, advanced AI topics, e.g., generative adversarial network, semi-supervised learning, and active learning, are discussed. They aim to address several critical issues in practical projects, e.g., the lack of well-labeled data and imbalanced labels, to improve the adaptability of the AI models.In Part IV, the new concept of “resilient AI” is introduced to establish an intelligent disaster prevention system, multi-modality learning, multi-task learning, and interpretable AI technologies. These advances are aimed towards increasing the robustness and explainability of the AI-enabled SHM system, and ultimately leading to improved resiliency.The scope covered in this book is not only beneficial for education purposes but also is essential for modern industrial applications. The target audience is broad and includes students, engineers, and researchers in civil engineering, statistics, and computer science.Unique Book Features:Provide a comprehensive review of the rapidly expanding field of vision-based structural health monitoring (SHM) using artificial intelligence approaches.Re-organize fundamental knowledge specific to the machine and deep learning in vision tasks.• Include comprehensive details about the procedure of conducting AI approaches for vision-based SHM along with examples and exercises.Cover a vast array of special topics and advanced AI-enabled vision-based SHM applications.List a few potential extensions for inspiring the readers for future investigation.
