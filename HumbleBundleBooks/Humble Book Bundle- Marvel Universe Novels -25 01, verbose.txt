HB Blurb: Marvel’s greatest heroes and villains battle for survival across the galaxy on an unknown planet in this prose adaptation of the classic graphic novel. In a flash of light, Earth’s mightiest heroes find themselves aboard a mysterious spaceship in an unfamiliar galaxy alongside a ship filled with their deadliest foes. They have been summoned to the strange planet known as Battleworld by an omnipotent cosmic entity, the Beyonder. His message is simple: “Slay your enemies and all you desire shall be yours . . ."The only hope the Avengers, the X-Men, Spider-Man, and the Fantastic Four have now is to prepare for a fight. But who among this murderers’ row of villainy poses the greatest threat? Is it the powerful Magneto? The manipulative Molecule Man? The world-eater, Galactus? Kang the Conqueror? Ultron, the robot whose only desire is to kill all life? Maybe it’s the enigmatic Beyonder? Or perhaps they should worry about what plans Doctor Doom has up his sleeve. With so many questions to answer, only one thing is certain: the battle royale begins now . . .

After revealing his secret identity as Iron Man, Tony Stark aims to engineer a better world. He is shifting the focus of Stark Industries from destructive weapons to life-improving technologies. With his revelation and his plan, Tony expects fame and adulation but he is only going to get more trouble . . After suffering a tragic, public failure, Tony knows he must improve Iron Man if he ever hopes to defeat a devastating new threat. One solution is a potentially lethal techno-organic virus known as Extremis. It will grant Tony more power than he has ever known—and test his spirit to the breaking point . . .Adapted from the graphic novel by Warren Ellis and Adi Granov.
Praise for Iron Man: Extremis“Javins is a masterful writer when it comes to convincing the reader of the sensory details of travel, of locations and their character, and even more adept at portraying characters in a psychologically realistic way. . . . The dialogue is as sharp, appealing, and funny as the films are known for, and are windows into character personality as well.” —The Beat

HB Blurb: Banished to outer space, the Hulk crashes on a treacherous planet where he incites an uprising in this adaptation of the blockbuster graphic novel. When a rogue general’s attack on the Hulk outside Las Vegas ends in deadly tragedy, a group of Earth’s heroes known as the Illuminati must make a difficult decision. While scientist Bruce Banner is not a killer, his alter-ego the Hulk is a threat to everyone—including himself. The Illuminati’s plan is to trick Banner into boarding a space shuttle to repair a dangerous satellite, only to send him to a peaceful planet where he can harm no one and no one can harm him. But when Banner learns of their betrayal, he loses control and transforms into the Hulk. In a fit of rage, he sets himself on a new course, crashing into the planet Sakaar where the tyrannical Red King rules through violence and anger. Captured and sold into slavery, Hulk becomes Green Scar, the planet’s mightiest and most popular gladiator. But his masters underestimate their new warrior . . . Forging a pact with his fellow gladiators Miek, Brood, Korg, Hiroim, and Elloe Kaifi, the Hulk sets a foundation for a revolution. It will either improve Sakaar or destroy it—and help Hulk satisfy his hunger for revenge.Adapted from the graphic novel by Greg Pak, Carlo Pagulayan and Aaron Lopresti.

But she finds it hard to look after herself when so many people need help. Hired to find a missing boy, Jessica follows a trail that ends with his dead body, the apparent victim of a drug overdose. Her gut instinct tells her the case isn’t solved, leading Jessica into an even deeper, darker mystery . . .

HB Blurb: T’Challa fights for Wakanda’s future while reckoning with its past in this original Marvel super hero story. Isolated from the world, the African kingdom of Wakanda is a land of scientific and technological marvels unknown to countries even on its own continent. Previous rulers believed that their nation could only survive by closely guarding Wakanda’s secrets and keeping them out of the hands of those who would exploit and weaponize them.
King T’Challa, the Black Panther, believes the time has come to share his nation’s knowledge and resources with the world, including former apartheid state Rudyarda. As Wakanda’s politicians debate for and against aiding a former colonized region with an infamous history, the kingdom’s past deeds come to light when T’Challa’s father, T’Chaka, is resurrected from the ancestral plane—prepared to reclaim both his rule and the Black Panther mantle.
But T’Chaka isn’t the only one to return from the spiritual realm. As dead men rise and political rivals act against him, T’Challa turns to those he trusts most—Shuri, Okoye, and Misty Knight—to uncover who, or what, is responsible for bringing the dead back to life. As the chaos spirals around him, threatening all of Wakanda, T’Challa must face T’Chaka and acknowledge the failings of his father’s rule.
Black Panther: Sins of the King is a collaborative novel by Ira Madison III, Geoffrey Thorne, Tananarive Due, Mohale Mashigo, and Steven Barnes.
