HB Blurb: Once Upon a Pixel examines the increasing sophistication of storytelling, worldbuilding and narrative techniques in video games. Drawing on recent examples such as Red Dead Redemption 2, The Last of Us 1 and 2, Firewatch, The Witness, long-running series such as Bioshock and others, and new developments in VR gaming, this book is the first to explore the potential of storytelling in games from the perspective of authors and teachers of creative writing. This collection arises from the lack of resources for players and creative writers about how games are written, not in terms of code or design, but in terms of story arcs, worldbuilding and the unique narrative techniques of newer games.

HB Blurb: While the earliest character representations in video games were rudimentary in terms of their presentation and performance, the virtual characters that appear in games today can be extremely complex and lifelike. These are characters that have the potential to make a powerful and emotional connection with gamers. As virtual characters become more intricate and varied, there is a growing need to examine the theory and practice of virtual character design. This book seeks to develop a series of critical frameworks to support the analysis and design of virtual characters.

HB Blurb: Seemingly every day there is a story in the process of how a successful app or game has earned so many thousands of downloads and revenue. The climate for the games industry has never been as hot as it is right now, and this is only set to continue as the marketplace for tablets/consoles and phones grow. As the market size increases, so does the number of people developing and looking to develop their own app or game to publish. The Indie Game Developer Handbook covers every aspect of running a game development studioâ€”from the initial creation of the game through to completion, release and beyond.

HB Blurb: To make videogames, artists and programmers must work together in pressure cooker environments. The problem is that they use the same words to mean completely different things, leading to rampant miscommunication. This book in written in both programmer-ese and artist-ese in order to present strategies for better communication. To make sure her suggestions hit the mark, the author teams with an artist and a programmer and avoids underlying tones hinting that one style of communication is better than the other.
