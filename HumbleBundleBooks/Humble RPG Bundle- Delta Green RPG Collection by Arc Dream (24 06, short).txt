HB Blurb: Fear is a fractal and your world is a lie. A horror freed from an antique book reverberates through reality, shaking things, reordering them and making them run like wax. Doors open to endless Victorian hallways where threats stalk the shadows on clockwork limbs, cold metal seeking the warmth of blood and bone. Madness pursues at every turn, baring its teeth to speak your name, and you can’t escape because it’s inside you. But don’t despair. There is hope. Beyond the tumbledown façade of the world, through the twists and tunnels of the human imagination, past the edge of everything sane, a King waits in the country of Carcosa. There, and only there, is the answer to everything. The last answer. A campaign featuring four operations that take Agents from the 1995 to 2015 and to places beyond time and understanding. Harrowing investigations and the bitterest truths test the mettle of the most accomplished Agents.
