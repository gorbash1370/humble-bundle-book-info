HB Blurb: FOUR SECRET AUDITIONS…Fixer BlotterBabe must have exactly the right actors for a production that requires very specialized talent. The actors must not only be skilled, they need to have the right attitude and an ability to adapt to extraordinary circumstances.A Kiss to Die For: Kintsugi and Sartorial choose love over duty, but their respective families will do everything in their considerable power to stop them from being together.See How She Runs: Terrapin witnesses a murder and is handed a package destined for some important and lethal people. Now she is running for her life.Unrepairable: Landon and Liana love vexing megacorps for fun and profit with their Matrix show. Unfortunately, the megacorps always play dirty, and will do whatever’s required to shut them down for good.The Kilimanjaro Run: Charlotte, Neema, and Elijah embark on an unexpected adventure that turns into a nightmare when they discover nothing is what it seems. They are left with no choice at all when choosing between the abhorrent and the right thing to do.FOR THE MOST DANGEROUS RUN OF ALL…Having auditioned thousands, BlotterBabe is out of time. It’s come down to these few teenagers. Either they will save the day or lose it all…“Cons, lies, double-crosses, flat-out thievery—all the fun stuff. Auditions reads like that great first act of a heist movie. Everyone’s showing off their particular set of skills while Brozek teases us with threads of what’s to come.” —NYT bestseller Peter Clines, author of The Broken Room“Brozek spins a clever introduction into the world of Shadowrun in Auditions. It’s perfect for newcomers, but also showcases shadows that have never been explored yet feel perfectly familiar.” —Crystal Frasier, author of Pathfinder: Spiral of Bones

HB Blurb: BLASTS FROM THE PAST…The Sixth World has always been a grim, violent place, where your life can be measured in heartbeats from one minute to the next. And whether you’re an experienced shadowrunner, or someone who’s entered the shadows looking for safety, or to hide—or perhaps start a new life altogether—well, they can be dark, deep, and dangerous, no matter how well-prepared you think you are.These five stories kick off with a pair of tales about Yuri and Soren, two fate-crossed lovers who meet in the drab, crumbling city of Vladivostok and flee their homeland for the Seattle sprawl, only to find life is nasty and brutish no matter where they go. That’s followed by Mr. Johnson’s worst nightmare—being hung out to die by the very corp he was working for. Now the guy who sent runners into the shadows must become one himself if he wants to get out of Atlanta alive. Finally, join professor and paranormal investigator Thomas McAllister as he investigates a string of supernatural serial killings and uncovers a dark conspiracy that stretches from Denver to Dallas, and threatens to engulf the rest of the UCAS if he doesn’t find a way to stop it.Five stories, each one a cautionary tale about the worst the Sixth World has to offer. So join both battle-scarred veterans and new recruits as they deal with the deadliest of shadows…

HB Blurb: INNOVATION, EXCELLENCE, INCLUSIVITY…INSANITY?!The Evo Corporation emerged from the troubled 2060s as a new company with a new mindset: having the most diverse and creative workforce in the Sixth World! Evo has embraced the three-way ideals of innovative augmentation, consistent excellence in their products, and being a metahuman-friendly corporation that makes metahuman-friendly products. Innovation, Excellence, and Inclusivity are Evo’s three pillars, and are celebrated in everything it does.Kenjiro Ishihara was fully brought up in that Evo mindset. Born into, raised, and educated by the most accepting megacorporation on Earth, he wants nothing more than to pay Evo back for the amazing life it has given him.But now Kenji finds himself ensnared in the bloodiest of megacorporate politics. With a manipulative, ruthless boss making a violent power play in the Seattle shadows, with coworkers out to take his head and curry favor, and with a rival branch escalating the warfare, Ishihara can only hold on by the skin of his teeth……until he learns he not only can’t trust his department, but perhaps not even his own mind!

On the other side, a loose alliance of shadowrunners, Awakened magic-users, and local tribespeople for whom the site of the fossil, nicknamed the Old Timer, is sacred land, and who will defend it by any means necessary.But when the megacorp ups the stakes by releasing a debilitating nanovirus among the scattered communities around the site, the shadowrunners do what they do best—execute a daring run both in the Matrix and real-time at the mining corp’s headquarters in search of something—anything—to get the corp to stand down. But will they succeed before the corp operators find the Old Timer and steal it away?

HB Blurb: STRIKE FROM THE SHADOWS…On the trail of her missing brother, shaman Rashida bint Tariq bin Feroze al-Nazari travels to South Africa to interrogate a corp executive who may have actually seen Qasim. But the meeting turns into a trap she barely escapes, and Rashida realizes she and her shadowrunning team have stumbled onto something much deeper than a rash of missing children.Their search for answers will take them from the glittering neon towers of Dubai to the harsh desert wilderness of the Arabian Caliphate. Rashida and her team scour every clue they find, whether it is in the deep African jungle, the artificial world of the Matrix, or the infinite astral plane, to uncover who’s masterminding this plot…and stop them before it can be put into action.And all the while, Rashida must contend with Scorpion, the insect spirit who came to her when she cried out for revenge against those who had killed her father and stolen her brother, and now lives within her in an uneasy alliance. Vicious, cunning, and deadly, Scorpion’s power always comes with a price…and if Rashida isn’t careful, she may end up paying it before she has the chance to save her brother…and punish the ones who took him.

HB Blurb: ON BLOODY GROUND…Dashiell Red Clay has spent decades as a soldier, a shadowrunner, a mercenary…above all, a warrior. He’s survived Goblinization, the Night of Rage, the passing of Halley’s Comet, the Second Matrix Crash, and more skirmishes, gunfights, and battles than almost anyone else alive. He knows more than most that history books are written in blood. It’s time for new chapters to be written.From watching armies gather like storm clouds in Africa to bloodily taking sides in the Aztlan/Amazonian War, from wading into the madness of the Great Dracon Civil War to taking part in a surprise winter invasion against the United Canadian American States itself, Dash faces greater threats than ever before. In the exciting conclusion to his trilogy, Dash must come to grips with the friends he has lost and the home he left behind, and must learn to wield the secret, hidden power of his blood—draconic power, and draconic blood—to find the balance between metahuman and monster.History is written in blood, but it’s written by people. And now it’s Dash’s turn, whether he likes it or not. The Blackbird trilogy is a series of short novels with military, Shadowrun-historical, and Native American Nation themes. Fans of Zimmerman’s Kincaid series will enjoy a first-person narrative exploring the history of the Sixth World through the Dash’s eyes, as he experiences the world of shadowrunners from a perspective a half-step removed from the shadows…but from the battlefield, not the streets, as paramilitary action spills from one famous conflict to the next, spanning decades in these three action-packed stories.

HB Blurb: NEVER STOP TRAINING…Dashiell Red Clay’s days on the field and at basic combat training might be behind him, but his life as a Salish Ranger has just begun…and there’s a lethal learning curve! Only life in The Sixth World can teach Dash what it means to be a member of the Salish Boat Service, what it means to serve your country, and what the word “country” even stands for in the fractured continents of Shadowrun’s dark future.Red Clay and his Rangers will clash with street gangs and elite soldiers alike, from the enigmatic, elven Ghosts to the legendary Wildcats of the NAN plains. Life will throw notorious mercenaries at him, cutthroat thrill-gangers, pride and shame, danger and love, and maybe even a street legend or two. From the barren mountains of Afghanistan to the filthy streets of Seattle, from the 2040s to the 2060s, from matters of the heart to tests of loyalty, Dash will face dangers Yakima never trained him for and threats “the book” never saw coming! The Blackbird series is a short novel trilogy with strong military, Shadowrun-historical, and Native American Nation themes. Fans of the Kincaid series will enjoy a first-person narrative exploring the history of the Sixth World through Dash’s eyes as he experiences the world of shadowrunners from a perspective a half-step removed from the shadows…on the battlefield, not the streets, as paramilitary action spills from one famous conflict to the next, spanning decades and three action-packed stories.

HB Blurb: TIES THAT BIND…Mage Jonathan Leeds has built himself a comfortable life owning and operating an exclusive night club in London, far from the iron grasp of his family. But when his father, Gordon, abruptly summons him to the Seattle Metroplex, John finds himself a stranger in a strange land, thrown into the wilds of the ’Plex to manage a situation apparently only he can handle. Although he’d prefer to ignore his father’s wishes, John knows that no one—family or foe—says no to Gordon Leeds. At least, not if they want to live to tell about it.But family obligations aren’t the only reason John is in Seattle. His patron back in England, Lord Callen Nassau, has asked him to look for a missing woman. John is only too happy to oblige, as the elegant elf noble is everything his father is not. But when Gordon’s and Callen’s tasks intertwine in unexpected ways, John is forced to question everything he knows about both men, and soon discovers not all that glitters is gold.When the desires of these rich and powerful beings collide in the Sixth World, John finds himself a pawn in their vicious game. If he’s to escape the Emerald City in one piece, John knows he must take control of the situation—any way he can—or suffer the lethal consequences.

Whether it’s traveling halfway around the world for a job or finding out his new employer has a much longer lifespan than the average metahuman, the dual-natured hacker/mage has always come out on top—and made a good living to boot.But in the Allied German States, he and the new team he’s leading are on unfamiliar ground. And when what should have been a milk run—transporting some high-tech computer gear from a corp lab to their employer—turns into a bloodbath, Janus and his team have to figure out what happened, who’s behind it, and what’s so important at this site that at least one megacorp is willing to kill to get their hands on it…before the rest of the corps turn their gaze—and guns—on the team.On the run for their lives, never knowing who to trust, Janus and his team unravel a tangled web of invention, deception, and death with a discovery at its core that could shake the very foundations of the Sixth World…or possibly bring it all crashing down around them…

HB Blurb: NO PLACE FOR A HERO…Jimmy Kincaid, burned-out mage, P. I., and the closest thing Puyallup’s got to a hero, has a lot on his plate these days. Simmering gang wars, feuding mobsters, missing runaways, magical power only as reliable as his stubborn sorcerous patron, and—well above his usual pay grade—an encrypted data file that’s already cost him friends, but that he can’t even access. When the always-dangerous troubles of the Seattle sprawl deepen into a bloody conspiracy with ties to neighboring nations and inhuman powers, he knows he’s on the job of his life. Facing the longest of long odds, Kincaid’s all too aware that the house always wins.Luckily, he’s not alone. A man like Jimmy can’t walk these shadowed streets without making enemies, but he’s made allies, too. With the help of his bounty-hunting best friends, an up-and-coming shadowrunner team, a former Lone Star detective who’s short in stature but big in style, and his loyal, albeit flighty ally spirit, Jimmy’s stacked the deck in his favor. Maybe he’s got a shot after all. Maybe he can make it all work. Maybe he can find the right balance, share the right truths, and make something good out of a whole lot of bad.Of course, the problem with a house of cards is it just takes one good hit to bring it all tumbling down…

HB Blurb: THE SHADOWS OF A MAN’S PAST ARE LONG…Cole Danvers is a small-time shadowrunner scratching out a living in the dangerous, divided sprawl of Denver, Colorado. But when a lucrative heist to steal an AmerIndian amulet goes terribly wrong, costing him both his teammates and nearly his life, Cole hits the streets intent on only one thing—vengeance.But as he tracks down the Johnson that sent him on this deadly mission, Cole quickly realizes he’s stumbled onto a plot much bigger than stealing a piece of jewelry—and that it’s somehow connected to his own shadowed past. Soon, he’s sucked into machinations that involve Native Americans, wily shamans, and impossibly, himself. And even sooner, Cole realizes he needs help to take down his enemies—before he gets killed for real this time.Assembling a motley crew of shadowrunners using every bit of guile and charisma he possesses, Cole sets out to solve the mystery of who tried to double-cross him and why—and what, if anything it has to do with his own murky background. But the answers may do more than just shock him—before it’s all over, they may just be the death of him…

With a legacy of runs under her belt, she has the solid reputation and wisdom that comes with surviving the shadows longer than most.Looking for a way to cash in on her street cred, Keandra comes up with a novel idea: Why not set herself up as a Johnson?

With her rep, she could take on high paying jobs and farm them out to other capable teams, minus a small cut as a finder’s fee. Everyone wins, and no one’s the wiser…unless someone makes the wrong call.And when a run goes south, Keandra and her team must scramble to salvage more than just their reputations. They are thrust into a situation which could start a new world war, and have to figure out who to trust, and fast…but trust is hard to come by in the shadows…

HB Blurb: DARK RUINS, DARKER SECRETS…Vaquita has had a rough go of it lately. She was doing all right, building a career as a London-based rigger, when something went wrong inside her head. Suddenly the mental space she used to have all to herself was shared as a foreign personality carved out a section of brain for herself. It wasn’t exactly madness, but it sure felt like it.It also made for some tough going for a time, and several lost jobs, but lately Vaquita’s gotten her swagger back. Her life may be a little trickier than the average runner’s, but she’s also got some skills she didn’t have before, not to mention new ways of bringing in the danger. And she has the perfect testing ground for her new abilities—the hulking, abandoned Angel Towers Arcology. Filled with squatters, gangs, vicious critters, and certain areas people only talk about in whispers, Angel Towers has enough danger and hidden caches of tech to keep a dozen teams of shadowrunners busy. But with her small, new team, Vaquita’s going to use it to not only rebuild her rep, but take it to the next level. But the arcology’s secrets and dangers go far deeper than Vaquita realizes, and she’ll have to deal with the perils at every turn—as well as the people who put them there.

HB Blurb: SOME SECRETS CAN KILL YOU...Kazuma Tetsu is a technomancer—one of the rare people who can manipulate the Matrix without technology, using only the power of their mind. But he's on a more personal mission—he's searching for his missing sister, Hitori. Following her trail leads him into a tangled web of corp execs, mercenaries, and double-crossing rogues—usually just another day in the Sixth World.But as Kazuma digs deeper, he uncovers a plot that could bring about the end of the world. Upon seeing a simulation of the Resonances Realms accessible to technomancers, an A.I. declares it will use the realms to ascend to a higher plane of consciousness. The intelligence's goal seems impossible, until an imprisoned and manipulated group of technomancers accesses dissonance to open a gateway to a new realm—possibly the heaven the A.I. seeks. But opening this dissonant hole in the Matrix could trigger global disaster, and it's up to a team of shadowrunners, including a couple of denizens of the fabled JackPoint, to free the trapped technomancers and stop the Dark Resonance before it destroys the entire Matrix—and worse...

Every job is to be executed swiftly and simply—no muss, no fuss, and with as little help as possible. But when an extraction of a seemingly ordinary grad student from a Central American dig goes south in a big way, Hawke has to keep them both alive while he figures out what he’s stumbled into—and how to get out of it in one piece.But nothing about this shadowrun is remotely ordinary. The student, Rachel Gordon, has unearthed an artifact linking the Sixth World and the long gone, magical Second World.

HB Blurb: DOWN THESE DARK STREETS…Most folks see Puyallup as the worst Seattle’s got to offer; a tangled mess of metahumanity and greed, poverty and ghettoes, vice and corruption, where the crime is more organized than the government. They call it a Barrens, an armpit, a cesspool.Jimmy Kincaid, though, calls it home. Walking the line between the shadows and the desperate light, semi-legit like only a local brat and former cop can be, he insists Puyallup has a heart and a soul, that it’s a place of life, magic, and starving hope. A former combat mage, now as burned out as his neighborhood, he does what he can to police the worst excesses of the crime-riddled city he loves.In the darkness of the Seattle Sprawl, what’s one more murder?To Kincaid, it’s everything. He’s got a dead mentor, a hermetic group in need, and a mysterious file that might have been worth killing for. To unlock the data and get a little justice, he’ll face the worst the Sprawl has to offer, wading through blood, darkness, and a murderous web of lies.It’s a good thing he’s got friends—in high and low places…

HB Blurb: OUT OF TIME, OUT OF OPTIONSJackPointer mage Winterhawk left the shadows at the top of his game: these days he indulges his curiosity about all things mysterious and magical on his own terms. But he’s about to discover that the shadows are hard to leave behind, and old enemies have their ways of drawing him back in.Dosed with an exotic arcane poison that will kill him in days unless he retrieves a powerful magical artifact, ’Hawk has to assemble a team fast and think even faster, because he’s not the only one tracking down the prize. His team is hardly the well-oiled machine he’s accustomed to: an old friend with major trust issues, an old rival who hates everything ’Hawk stands for, a decker who annoys everyone he meets, a samurai who’s only in it for the money, and a gunslinger who may have her own agenda.With his life on the line and the clock ticking fast, ’Hawk must survive the mean streets of Los Angeles and the magical hells cape of the Australian Outback while keeping his mismatched team from imploding before they finish the job. But when the artifact is revealed to be far more than it seems, Winterhawk is forced to make a choice that could affect the lives of millions—to say nothing of his own.

When he's hired to find an ancient map purported to lead to a mysterious location at the bottom of the world, his professional curiosity is more than roused. But his quest to simply get his hands on the map is more dangerous than he expected—even for a shadowrunner.He and his own team of runners—including everything from a goblin rigger to a troll street samurai—follow a murky trail that takes them from the ruins of Chicago to the jungles of Amazonia. Along the way, they discover that they’re not the only ones looking for this map—and that it may lead to a treasure even greater than anyone could have known. Elijah and his crew plan to get both the map and to its riches first—assuming they survive the very dangerous road trip to get there...
