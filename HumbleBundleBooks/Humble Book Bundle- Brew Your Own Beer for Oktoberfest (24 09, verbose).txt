HB Blurb: Enjoy a quick brew day and make Gose, Smoked Ale, Pennsylvania Swankey, Strawberry-Peppercorn Short Mead, Tart Blackberry Cider, Boozy Kombucha, Kefir Beer, Absinthola, Mauby, Tepache, and more!Homebrew tastes great, it's inexpensive to make, and it's equally fun to brew old favorites and new recipes. There's only one thing stopping you from brewing your 1st or 101st batch: time. Whether it's your kids, your job, or a million other things, it can be hard to find a free brew day. Then there's the agonizing wait to crack that first cap.But what if you could brew a session IPA in just a few hours? Or if you could brew a sour beer that's ready to drink in weeks instead of months? In Speed Brewing, author Mary Izett shows you how to make it happen. Whether you're a new or experienced brewer, you'll find time-saving techniques and recipes that save hours on brew day. You'll also find beers, ciders, and meads that pack big flavors but ferment quickly. Lesser-known fast fermentables--boozy kombucha, kefir beer, spirited sodas, and more--ensure there are plenty of exciting experiments for even the most creative brewer. Whether you decide to brew the Bia Hoi, Smoked Summer Ale, or Strawberry-Peppercorn Short Mead, weeknights will never be the same.

HB Blurb: As the craft beer craze continues to sweep the nation, more and more people are deciding to try their hand at creating their own perfect brew. In Craft Beer for the Homebrewer, beer writer and certified cicerone (think sommelier for beer) Michael Agnew merges the passions of consumption and creation into one definitive guidebook, designed for the craft beer lover who also happens to be a homebrew enthusiast. Agnew presents dozens of recipes adapted by craft brewmasters for the homebrewer to make in his or her own kitchen, basement, garage, or patio. Based on the actual production beers of featured microbreweries, these recipes cover the entire range of beer styles--ambers and pales, IPAs, stouts and porters, Irish and Scottish ales, Belgians, and wheats--representing craft breweries from across the United States. Each recipe is accompanied by full-color photography, an ingredient list, instructions for both the mash and extract brewer, and historical and anecdotal notes about the brewery that provided it. Agnew prefaces the book with an introduction to the craft beer industry, briefly discussing the major ingredients and required equipment that homebrewers will encounter inside. With its meticulous selection of delicious beer varieties, Craft Beer for the Homebrewer offers a beautifully designed collection of microbrews for the homebrewer on the cutting edge of the craft beer scene.
