HB Blurb: Like the best advice from a therapist, career counselor, and savvy best friend, this practical resource details dozens of concrete ways to improve work life in any kind of job or entrepreneurial setting. As Minda Zetlin shows, basic self-care principles are the key, and they apply in both tranquil and turbulent times. Her prescriptions are action-ready and available to all. They include: taking doable steps to get from where you are to where you dream of being; cultivating both mentors and sponsors (and understanding the difference); navigating the ongoing issues of gender and race bias at work; dealing with toxic coworkers, including bosses; supercharging the brain for reaching goals; incorporating detoxifying mindfulness practices, such as ultra-brief meditation breaks, simple breathing exercises, and power journaling. Not just another list of things to do, this invaluable book is there to help in moments of overwhelm or indecision, at the end of a long day, or any time when you need a reminder of your whole-self aspirations and what you’re capable of.

ISBN-10: 1608687368 - ISBN-13: 9781608687367 - ASIN: B09634NNQC

HB Blurb: Reconnect with Your Body and Nature to Heal from Trauma As psychologist and mindfulness teacher Rochelle Calvert explores in this powerful book, one of the greatest sources of healing from trauma is all around us — nature. Dr. Calvert shows how to relate to and connect with nature through the practice of mindfulness to calm and relax the nervous system, tune in to the somatic wisdom of the body to face lingering trauma and rewire it, and work with painful experiences to transform them in ways that heal the individual and contribute to healing the wider world. Healing with Nature pioneers a path not just to recovery but to lifelong healing and resilience.

Book 03:
Title: Panic Free
Author(s): Tom Bunn
---
ISBN-10: 1608686051 - ISBN-13: 9781608686056 - ASIN: B07Q411RVX

HB Blurb: What if you could stop panic by tapping into a different part of your brain? Through natural stimulation of your vagus nerve, you can end panic and anxiety, and this book can show you how. After years of working to help sufferers of panic and anxiety, licensed therapist (and pilot) Tom Bunn discovered a highly effective solution that utilizes a part of the brain not affected by the stress hormones that bombard a person experiencing panic. This “unconscious procedural memory” can be programmed to control panic by preventing the release of stress hormones and activating the parasympathetic nervous system. This process, outlined in Panic Free, sounds complicated but is not, requiring just ten days and no drugs or doctors. Bunn includes specific instructions for dealing with common panic triggers, such as airplane travel, bridges, MRIs, and tunnels. Because panic is profoundly life-limiting, the program Bunn offers can be a real life-changer.

HB Blurb: Use verbal prompts and practices to become the person you want to be When wellness star Vasavi Kumar suggests “saying it out loud,” she means it literally. Years of journaling in an attempt to learn about herself and meet her goals hadn’t worked, so she decided to talk to herself instead, out loud and with the compassion of a best friend. She used this technique as she journeyed through the challenges of being the daughter of Indian immigrants, a bipolar diagnosis, substance abuse, and recovery. Along the way, Vasavi learned that all the outside expert guidance in the world was no substitute for finding ways of tuning in to her truest inner self, hearing that self’s guidance and wisdom, and then living it with resilience and empathy. In Say It Out Loud, she gives simple verbal prompts to help you voice your deepest desires and reframe negative self-talk so you can heal from past experiences, go after your dreams, and become more intentional, focused, and compassionate.

HB Blurb: Expertly designed and decorated homes don’t necessarily feel like havens to their dwellers or reflect, inspire, and celebrate what is essential about their inhabitants. Lauded designer and architectural conservator Xorin Balbes created the eight-stage SoulSpace transformation process to help his clients do just that. Through the stages — assess, release, cleanse, dream, discover, create, elevate, and celebrate — readers explore not only the design of their living spaces but also their own interiors: the ways they think, feel, and sense. Through client stories, exercises, Q & As, and bountiful photos and illustrations, Balbes guides readers to decode clues to what they wish for, deny, and need to move forward. Empowered with this self-knowledge, they are free to declutter, refresh, and enhance their living spaces. Suitable for any budget and for one wall or one room, apartments or mansions, Balbes’s wonderfully unique technique nurtures and transforms both souls and their spaces.
