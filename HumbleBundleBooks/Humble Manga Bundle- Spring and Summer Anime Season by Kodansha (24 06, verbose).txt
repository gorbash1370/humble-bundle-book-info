HB Blurb: Chi is completely settled into her new home and it is now time for some real adventures! With so many new furry and feathery comrades around she is bound to have at least a few opportunities to explore this new world of hers...Or so she thought. Instead Chi might end up becoming more of a house cat than ever before. Despite living in a pet friendly building, Chi still has not had too many chances to go outdoors. Instead her fellow feline neighbors come visit her in her turf. Furthermore these posh and pomp kittens are not really the like that would appreciate a wild romp in the park or dumpster diving in a dark alley. Nope these cats would much rather lounge and be pampered by doting humans.

HB Blurb: For Mito, being the thrall of a vampire is the least of her worries.    Mito's lived life on the streets since she graduated from middle school, dressing as a boy to stay safe. She's managed to eke out a grungy, friendless existence, but when a handsome vampire, Ruka, rescues her from sure-death, he makes her an offer that sounds too good to be true: become his subservient thrall from which he can feed whenever he wants, and she can live with him-in the boys' dorm. Because her very existence depends on her secret not being found out, every day is a new danger-to say nothing of what living with a vampire could mean! Ruka, not knowing Mito's a girl, dotes on her night and day in an attempt to ripen her ""disgusting male blood,"" but the closer he gets to her, the more likely her secret could get out...and the closer she gets to having her new, wonderful life come crashing down around her...    A heart-pounding, (blood)-thirsty new romance from the award-winning Ema Toyama (Missions of Love, Aoba-kun's Confessions)!

So when a 37-year-old Tokyo salaryman dies and wakes up in a world of dragons and magic, he’s a little disappointed to find he’s become a blind, boneless slime monster. Mikami’s middle age hasn’t gone as he planned: He never found a girlfriend, he got stuck in a dead-end job, and he was abruptly stabbed to death in the street at 37. So when he wakes up in a new world straight out of a fantasy RPG, he’s disappointed but not exactly surprised to find that he’s not a knight or a wizard but a blind slime demon. But there are chances for even a slime to become a hero…
