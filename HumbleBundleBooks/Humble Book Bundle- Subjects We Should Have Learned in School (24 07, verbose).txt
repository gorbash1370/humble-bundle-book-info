HB Blurb: A step-by-step guide to home repairs large and small from Popular Mechanics—the name that’s “synonymous with the ultimate in DIY knowledge” (Booklist, starred review).  Got a squeaky floor or a rattling door? Is your grout a color you don’t recognize anymore? From quick fixes like linking broken chains and patching drywall to more involved projects like replacing a fuel line and bleeding your brakes, Popular Mechanics How to Fix Anything is the handy and reliable go-to guide for the most common household problems—offering a primer on plumbing; unexpected hacks like using a golf tee to fill a stripped screw hole; instructions for tuning up the garage door; and so much more.  Throughout the book Roy Berendsohn, Popular Mechanics’ senior home editor, answers questions about the trickiest fix-its, including how to deal with recurring ceiling cracks or get rid of that stench from the kitchen sink. And because it’s organized room by room, from basement to bathroom to bedroom, it’s simple to find the solution you need—so you won’t have to hire someone else to do the job.

Non-Obvious Book Awards Best Book of 2023 Heal yourself to heal the world: The Power of Empathy is an informative and inspirational guide to building a better world through compassion, connection, and curiosity. With this thirty-day approach, you can develop your empathy skills as tools for self-love and empowerment.

HB Blurb: From Nancy Lawson, author of The Humane Gardener, a first-of-its-kind guide that takes readers on an insightful and personal exploration of the secret lives of animals and plants. Master naturalist Nancy Lawson takes readers on a fascinating tour of the vibrant web of nature outside our back door-where animals and plants perceive and communicate using marvelous sensory abilities we are only beginning to understand. Organized into chapters investigating each of their five senses, Lawson's exploration reveals a remarkable world of interdependent creatures with amazing capabilities. You'll learn of ultrasound clicks humans can't hear, and ultraviolet colors humans can't see. You'll cross paths with foraging American bumblebees drawn to the scent of wild bergamot, urban sparrows who adapt their mating song in response to human clamor, trees that amp up their growth in response to deer and moose saliva, and a chipmunk behaving like the world's smallest pole vaulter to nab juicy red berries hanging from the lowest parts of a coral honeysuckle vine. Synthesizing cutting-edge scientific research, original interviews with animal and plant researchers, and poetic observations made in her own garden, Lawson shows us how to appreciate the natural environment from the sensory perspective of our wild neighbors right outside our door and beyond, and how to respect and nurture the habitats they need to survive.

HB Blurb: Accountability means accepting responsibility for your actions and repairing any harm you have done. This book can be used by anyone who is ready to do the work to change toxic behaviors and patterns, from quitting smoking to atoning for abuse or crimes. At its heart, accountability is understanding that your actions do not always have the impact that you intend. Sometimes this is as simple as getting to know yourself and apologizing. Sometimes it's a years-long process to recognize the motivations and behaviors that you see inside yourself and feel like you have no control over. Ultimately, accountability is something we each must choose for ourselves; nobody else can do it for us. The results can be unexpected and transformative, and improve your friendships, relationships, work, and community; most of all it's about coming to peace with yourself. The authors share tough lessons learned through many years of personal and professional experience. This book will walk you through your own head to understand your own patterns and behaviors, untangle them, and live the kind of life you want.

HB Blurb: A positively rebellious take on a traditionally negative philosophy offers an antidote for our anxious times. Career success, a beautiful life, a beautiful Instagram account-what's the point? In a world where meaning has become twisted into a form of currency that everyone is very keen to cash in on, journalist Wendy Syfret invites you to change the way you think about the way you think. In her seminal work, The Sunny Nihilist, Syfret presents the optimism in Nihilism, encouraging us to dismantle our self-care and self-centered way of living and accept a life more or less ordinary. Syfret re-examines the meaning of worth, value, time, happiness, success, and connection, and guides us towards the alternative path of pointless pleasure. When you let go of the idea that everything must have purpose, you will find relief from stress, exhaustion, and anxiety. Most importantly, you can embrace the opportunity to enjoy the moment, the present, the chaos and luck of being alive at all. The Sunny Nihilist is an inspiring call to action and survival adaptation for modern life.

HB Blurb: In his twenty years as a freelance journalist, Jeremy Dillahunt learned a thing or two about job seeking. Chief among them was one undeniable fact—the Internet has changed everything. The old rules no longer apply and if you want to get hired today, your resume just doesn't work. The Internet does. So Jeremy decided to figure out how. In 2015, nearly 60 million job openings were accessible to jobseekers nationwide—thanks to the Internet. But this access is only one part of the equation. For many jobseekers, a huge challenge remains—how do I get my resume in front the hiring manager, and how do I use the Internet to do it?F*ck Your Resume is the complete all-in-one-guide to move beyond the traditional resume-for-hire system and use the Internet to optimize one's chances of finding and landing the job. According to Jeremy Dillahunt, the Internet is just not just one way to find a job—it is the only way. Built on Dillahunt's research of current hiring trends, F*ck Your Resume nails down the top factors that recruiters and hiring managers consider when evaluating candidates. The Internet-based approach presented in this book provides practical, step-by-step instructions that will help you:Get It Done—create a strong, professional online presence on networking sites such as LinkedIn, Twitter, and Facebook. Push Yourself—move your profile up the job boards with tips for personal branding. Face It— you're going to show up in a search result, so look good when you do. Power Up—connect with a reputable network of professionals who you'd want to be associated with. Sound Off— this may be your only chance to "talk" to a potential employer, deliver a message that is clear, consistent, and competitive.Additional features include: Surprising facts and candid advice from top-notch recruiters * "The Worst Resumes Ever" * The Five Secrets of Job-Interview Success * The Five Secrets of Salary Negotiation * and much more!

HB Blurb: In over 200 recipes, Jessica Fisher shows time-pressed cooks how they can eat remarkably well without breaking the bank. Good Cheap Eats serves up 65 two-course dinners, consisting of a main dish and a substantial side, salad, or soup, all of which take 30 minutes or less to prepare. And as a mother of six and a busy parent, she shows home cooks how to get dinner on the table quickly and inexpensively without relying on heavily processed shortcuts or artificial ingredients. Great for time-pressed couples, families with picky eaters, or singles that need a quick solution to dinner tonight, Jessica's two-course pairings are artfully conceived and perfectly complementary.
