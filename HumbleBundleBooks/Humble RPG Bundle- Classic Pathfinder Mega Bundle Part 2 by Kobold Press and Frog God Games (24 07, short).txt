HB Blurb: A vast and sorcerous city poisoned by alchemy and extending its empire through necromantically-powered industries, the City-state of Castorhage is gritty, often horrific, and heartless. The city-state has begun exploring realms beyond the normal world, heedless of the dangers and unaware that these other worlds are exploring the city-state in return. Ruthless factions, many of them quite monstrous, wage a hidden war for control of the city, its bizarre “technologies,” and its cruel empire.Two books in one, The Blight: Richard Pett’s Crooked City is everything you need for a campaign set in Castorhage, the city known to most simply as "The Blight." Set in the Lost Lands campaign setting, this book consists of The Blight Campaign Guide — which includes the Cyclopædia Infestarum, a huge collection of new monsters, NPCs, and other resources for the setting — as well as a ten-chapter gazetteer to the city’s districts. It also includes the Levee Adventure, a nine-part series of adventures that introduces your players to their first taste of the Blight and its rotten and degenerate urban confines.

Published Date:

HB Blurb: Under the heat of the salted sun, along a pirate-riddled coast bloated fat with forgotten riches and forbidden secrets, the subjugation of the native tribes awakens long banished horrors. Horrors whose deadly plans threaten not only Port Shaw—the corrupt fingerhold of a distant and decadent civilization—but existence, itself. A sea of blood caresses the savage shore of the Razor. Rising from the abyssal depths, Harthagoa, the bastard spawn of a She-Kraken and Demogorgon drags whole fleets beneath the waves. In the fetid Blacksink Marsh, unspeakable horrors lurk beneath the bog water, accursed cannibals pay gory obeisance to an ancient shark god of slaughter—begging its return. A ghostly armada, murderous pirates, and balesharks prowl the waves—all threaten Port Shaw, the only bastion of "civilization" on the Razor. The city hosts foreign invaders chasing baleen, ambergris, and gold. They menace the native Tulita tribes and drive them from their ancestral home with smoke-belching cannonade. Pele, The Goddess of Fire and Wrack, watches from her smoldering throne on Dreadsmoke Mountain. She stands ever ready to purge the people of Port Shaw from her domain in a torrent of ash and molten lava.

HB Blurb: Collection of Dark and Daring Adventures. What happens when adventurers become the owners of a brothel? When a roguish associate asks them to attend an oligarch’s masquerade in his place? What lurks in the Cartways besides kobolds? And what will you say when another thief tells you the only way to find a treasure is to become hunted by the Praetors?
Dark dealings, my boys, and a knife in the guts might be the price. Whose guts? Might be yours if you cross the wrong one of the Nine. This 94-page supplement and adventure anthology is set in the seedy underbelly of Zobeck, and on its mean streets you will find:
• Seven adventures dealing with underhanded themes, shady locations, and double-crossing deals gone wrong• Six locales including the Cartways Market Gallery or the Old Stross Municipal Baths.• A dirty dozen NPCs: kobold gearsmiths, failed Arcane Collegium students, barge captains, fey and undead ambassadors to use as rivals, patrons, peers and foes• A sampling of new clockworks, street magics and odd enchantments that make Zobeck the distinctive jewel of the River Argent!
You probably shouldn’t bring the paladin along on this one…

HB Blurb: Deep in the wooded wilderness, the village of Grimmsgate is an outpost town on a seldom-traveled trail, right at the edge of nowhere. The village’s half-ruined temple of Law, dilapidated inn, drunken blacksmith, exiled trader and a few fur-trappers are enough to keep the bloody-minded denizens of the dark forest at bay, but nobody really expects the village to still be there in another ten years. The woods have become too dangerous for the trappers who once caught animals for fur, and merchants no longer travel the poorly-maintained road because of bandits. None of the nearby barons are willing to accept responsibility for the village, because the one and only attempt that was ever made to subdue this part of the wilderness, a patrolling troop of knights and soldiers, completely disappeared in the forest without leaving a trace. When the search parties also failed to return, civilization gave up on Grimmsgate and departed, making no further efforts to stave off the slow advance of Chaos.
