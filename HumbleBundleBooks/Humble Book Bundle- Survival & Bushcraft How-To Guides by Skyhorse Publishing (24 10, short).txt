HB Blurb: Have you ever thought you were being followed or watched? Have you ever needed to follow or observe someone and not be seen?In the world of espionage, surveillance and surveillance detection are a way of life. It is the job of every CIA operations officer to make sure he or she is not under surveillance—that is, being followed to the commission of an “operational act.” It is also the job of every CIA operations officer to surveil his own targets, whether they are terrorists or terrorist suspects, foreign intelligence officers, hostile actors, or even sometimes his own agents for vetting purposes.

Whether avoiding a stalker, checking up on an unfaithful partner, or just securing one’s own privacy, a working knowledge of modern surveillance and surveillance detection techniques is a critical skill to possess. And there is nobody better to teach that skill than someone trained by the CIA.From former CIA counterterrorism officer John C. Kiriakou, Surveillance and Surveillance Detection: A CIA Insider's Guide takes you through the CIA's surveillance and surveillance detection program. It will teach you to apply CIA surveillance techniques to your own everyday life. You’ll learn how to stay safe, to ensure your privacy, and to keep the honest people honest—the CIA way.

HB Blurb: Become an expert at finding food, water, shelter, security, establishing communication, maintaining your health, navigating, and making fire.Many survival and emergency preparedness experts today use the pyramid approach to survival prioritization, putting food, water, shelter, and security in the largest block at the base of the pyramid and then community, sustainability, and higher needs in smaller brackets at the top of the pyramid. Decorated combat veteran Brian M. Morris takes a different and linear approach to survival using an eight-pillar system, developed over decades of serving as a Green Beret in the US Army Special Forces. The foundation for Morris's methodology is KISS, which stands for “keep it simple, stupid,” an acronym widely used by the military to remind soldiers that the best solutions are often the simplest. In his eight-pillar system, it is up to the survivor to assess their situation and then choose the pillar that is needed most to survive the situation at hand. Much like a rifle pop-up target range where a shooter is expected to hit the closer (more dangerous) 50-meter target first before engaging the 300-meter target, the survivor needs to choose the pillar that is most urgent and necessary to save their life under the circumstances.

HB Blurb: The Weekend Homesteader is organized by month—so whether it’s January or June you’ll find exciting, short projects that you can use to dip your toes into the vast ocean of homesteading without getting overwhelmed. If you need to fit homesteading into a few hours each weekend and would like to have fun while doing it, these projects will be right up your alley, whether you live on a forty-acre farm, a postage-stamp lawn in suburbia, or a high rise.   You'll learn about backyard chicken care, how to choose the best mushroom and berry species, and why and how to plant a no-till garden that heals the soil while providing nutritious food.  Permaculture techniques will turn your homestead into a vibrant ecosystem and attract native pollinators while converting our society's waste into high-quality compost and mulch. Meanwhile, enjoy the fruits of your labor right away as you learn the basics of cooking and eating seasonally, then preserve homegrown produce for later by drying, canning, freezing, or simply filling your kitchen cabinets with storage vegetables. As you become more self-sufficient, you'll save seeds, prepare for power outages, and tear yourself away from a full-time job, while building a supportive and like-minded community. You won't be completely eliminating your reliance on the grocery store, but you will be plucking low-hanging (and delicious!) fruits out of your own garden by the time all forty-eight projects are complete.

Sounds kind of magical, doesn’t it? It kind of is.Fermenting is what happens when you mix two things together: food and salt. As soon as food and salt are combined, they wake up microbes—bacteria and yeast that are living in and on the food. This book explores a specific type of fermentation: raw pickling or live-fermentation. Live-fermented foods are the healthiest to eat and easiest to make. Live-fermentation is simpler than canning and the food lasts longer than freezing. This technique saves time and energy, as it cuts down on heating and cooking. Live-fermented foods do not require refrigeration. Plus, they can stay fresh indefinitely.In addition to saving energy costs, fermenting increases a food’s health benefits. Live-fermented foods are healthier than their original raw products. Vital nutrients and vitamins—often destroyed with heating—are not only kept alive, but improved. And other nutrients are actually created during fermentation.Susan Crowther and Julie Fallone offer step-by-step instructions for pickling and fermenting all kinds of produce from carrots to garlic to sweet potatoes, plus offers recipes for Live-Fermented Hot Sauce, Fermented Hot Honey, and more unique and healthy goodies. Readers will also find recipes for kombucha, jun tea, and other probiotic drinks.
