HB Blurb: In the first edition of this critically acclaimed book, Andrew Hoffman defined the three pillars of application security: reconnaissance, offense, and defense. In this revised and updated second edition, he examines dozens of related topics, from the latest types of attacks and mitigations to threat modeling, the secure software development lifecycle (SSDL/SDLC), and more.Hoffman, senior staff security engineer at Ripple, also provides information regarding exploits and mitigations for several additional web application technologies such as GraphQL, cloud-based deployments, content delivery networks (CDN) and server-side rendering (SSR). Following the curriculum from the first book, this second edition is split into three distinct pillars comprising three separate skill sets:Pillar 1: Recon—Learn techniques for mapping and documenting web applications remotely, including procedures for working with web applicationsPillar 2: Offense—Explore methods for attacking web applications using a number of highly effective exploits that have been proven by the best hackers in the world. These skills are valuable when used alongside the skills from Pillar 3.Pillar 3: Defense—Build on skills acquired in the first two parts to construct effective and long-lived mitigations for each of the attacks described in Pillar 2.

HB Blurb: Trillions of lines of code help us in our lives, companies, and organizations. But just a single software cybersecurity vulnerability can stop entire companies from doing business and cause billions of dollars in revenue loss and business recovery. Securing the creation and deployment of software, also known as software supply chain security, goes well beyond the software development process. This practical book gives you a comprehensive look at security risks and identifies the practical controls you need to incorporate into your end-to-end software supply chain. Author Cassie Crossley demonstrates how and why everyone involved in the supply chain needs to participate if your organization is to improve the security posture of its software, firmware, and hardware. With this book, you'll learn how to: Pinpoint the cybersecurity risks in each part of your organization's software supply chainIdentify the roles that participate in the supply chain—including IT, development, operations, manufacturing, and procurementDesign initiatives and controls for each part of the supply chain using existing frameworks and referencesImplement secure development lifecycle, source code security, software build management, and software transparency practicesEvaluate third-party risk in your supply chain

HB Blurb: As the transformation to hybrid multicloud accelerates, businesses require a structured approach to securing their workloads. Adopting zero trust principles demands a systematic set of practices to deliver secure solutions. Regulated businesses, in particular, demand rigor in the architectural process to ensure the effectiveness of security controls and continued protection.This book provides the first comprehensive method for hybrid multicloud security, integrating proven architectural techniques to deliver a comprehensive end-to-end security method with compliance, threat modeling, and zero trust practices. This method ensures repeatability and consistency in the development of secure solution architectures. Architects will learn how to effectively identify threats and implement countermeasures through a combination of techniques, work products, and a demonstrative case study to reinforce learning. You'll examine:The importance of developing a solution architecture that integrates security for clear communicationRoles that security architects perform and how the techniques relate to nonsecurity subject matter expertsHow security solution architecture is related to design thinking, enterprise security architecture, and engineeringHow architects can integrate security into a solution architecture for applications and infrastructure using a consistent end-to-end set of practicesHow to apply architectural thinking to the development of new security solutionsAbout the authorsMark Buckwell is a cloud security architect at IBM with 30 years of information security experience. Carsten Horst with more than 20 years of experience in Cybersecurity is a certified security architect and Associate Partner at IBM.Stefaan Van daele has 25 years experience in Cybersecurity and is a Level 3 certified security architect at IBM.

HB Blurb: Security is usually an afterthought when organizations design microservices for cloud systems. Most companies today are exposed to potential security threats, but their responses are often more reactive than proactive. This leads to unnecessarily complicated systems that are hard to implement and even harder to manage and scale. Author Gaurav Raje shows you how to build highly secure systems on AWS without increasing overhead.Ideal for cloud solution architects and software developers with AWS experience, this practical book starts with a high-level architecture and design discussion, then explains how to implement your solution in the cloud while ensuring that the development and operational experience isn't compromised. By leveraging the AWS Shared Responsibility Model, you'll be able to:Develop a modular architecture using microservices that aims to simplify compliance with various regulations in finance, medicine, and legal servicesIntroduce various AWS-based security controls to help protect your microservices from malicious actorsLeverage the modularity of the architecture to independently scale security mechanisms on individual microservices Improve the security posture without compromising the autonomy or efficiency of software development teams

HB Blurb: If you hope to outmaneuver threat actors, speed and efficiency need to be key components of your cybersecurity operations. Mastery of the standard command-line interface (CLI) is an invaluable skill in times of crisis because no other software application can match the CLI‚Äôs availability, flexibility, and agility. This practical guide shows you how to use the CLI with the bash shell to perform tasks such as data collection and analysis, intrusion detection, reverse engineering, and administration.Authors Paul Troncone, founder of Digadel Corporation, and Carl Albing, coauthor of bash Cookbook (O‚ÄôReilly), provide insight into command-line tools and techniques to help defensive operators collect data, analyze logs, and monitor networks. Penetration testers will learn how to leverage the enormous amount of functionality built into nearly every version of Linux to enable offensive operations.In four parts, security practitioners, administrators, and students will examine:Foundations: Principles of defense and offense, command-line and bash basics, and regular expressionsDefensive security operations: Data collection and analysis, real-time log monitoring, and malware analysisPenetration testing: Script obfuscation and tools for command-line fuzzing and remote accessSecurity administration: Users, groups, and permissions; device and software inventory
