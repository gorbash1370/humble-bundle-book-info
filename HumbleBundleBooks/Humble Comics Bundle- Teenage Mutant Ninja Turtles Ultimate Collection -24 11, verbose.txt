HB Blurb: RETURN TO THE RONIN-VERSE! In TMNT: The Last Ronin, readers were taken on a pulse-pounding trek through time—past, present, future—to witness the final gut-wrenching days of the Heroes in a Half-Shell. In Last Ronin–Lost Years, new secrets of the Turtles’ past are revealed as we learn more about the devastating series of events leading up to the Last Ronin’s final battle, as well as its aftermath. For Michelangelo in particular, the march to his heartbreaking last battle was long and dangerous, taking him from New York City, to Japan, across Asia and Europe, and then back home again to administer final justice against those guilty of killing his family. But what happened during those fateful years when he had only the need for vengeance and Master Splinter’s journal to guide him? What battles did he fight? What hard lessons did he learn? The time has come to find out as original miniseries writers Kevin Eastman and Tom Waltz join artist Ben Bishop (TMNT: The Last Ronin) and SL Gallant (G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero) to finally reveal what adventures the Last Ronin experienced during his vengeful journey. While in the present, a new master, Casey Marie Jones, prepares her young terrapin students to be the next generation of…Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles! Collects the five-issue series and the TMNT: Lost Day Special.

HB Blurb: Leonardo leads, Donatello does machines, Raphael is cool but rude, Michelangelo is a party dude! The animated Turtles of the original cartoon are back! The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles first appeared in 1984, but it wasn’t until 1987 that a catchy theme song and action-packed cartoon helped make them a global phenomenon! Now discover four “lost episodes” that follow in the radical two-toed footsteps of the classic series. First, an unexpected power surge leaves the brothers trapped in a virtual training program, facing digital versions of their most fearsome foes, in “VR in Deep Trouble”! Next, a mysterious piece of tech transforms one of Krang’s stone soldiers into a power ballad–belting rockstar, but how long will the change last? It’s a hair metal adventure “For Those About to Rock”! Then Casey Jones gets superpowers, and he can’t wait to up his crime-fighting game. But when Raph and the others learn his powers come at a cost, can they convince “Super Casey” to give them up? And finally, when Baxter Stockman injects Splinter with microscopic mousers, Donny will have to shrink himself down to save his sensei, in “Big Trouble in Master Splinter”! Writer Erik Burnham (Ghostbusters, G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero—Saturday Morning Adventures) authentically captures ’80s pop culture so that it holds true for longtime fans while immediately appealing to today’s younger audience, and artist Tim Lattie nails the cartoon’s signature look. Grab a slice and settle in with the world’s most fearsome fighting team, the heroes in a half shell! Turtle power!
