They forged the Imperium in bloody combat as they waged the Great Crusade across the galaxy.

Of these nine Chapters, First Founding features the final four Chapters not discussed in previous Deathwatch rulebooks.

HB Blurb: After centuries lost in the Warp, the Ardent Crown has returned in a degrading orbit around the world of Solace. This vessel vanished carrying a number of important relics, and in this Deathwatch adventure, a Kill-team has been assembled to board the derelict as it drifts toward the world of Solace, secure the sacred artefacts, and extract from the voidship.However, the Battle-Brothers are not alone in their ambitions aboard the Ardent Crown. An Eldar Farseer also has designs for a particular relic, and leads an elite team of her allies in her quest to take it back. And while the Eldar are powerful and duplicitous foes, something even more terrible lurks aboard the Ardent Crown, stirring after aeons of cold slumber as footsteps fall once again on the long-abandoned decks. The Battle- Brothers of the Deathwatch must face these enemies, cast them down in the name of the Emperor, and escape the Ardent Crown before it plummets to its demise. The fate of the sector and the honour of the Deathwatch alike hang in the balance.Originally written for use at Gen Con Indy 2013, Binding Contracts, Falling Star, Shedding Light, and Savaging Solace are adventures for Warhammer 40,000 Roleplaying. The four linked scenarios concern the fate of the Imperial world of Solace. While each adventure stands on its own as a complete module suitable for immediate play, a group that plays all four adventures will spot the connections between the events as they transpire around the hive world of Solace.Binding Contracts, Falling Star, Shedding Light, and Salvaging Solace each include a full adventure, pre-generated characters, and the profiles for any NPCs unique to the adventure. Each is designed to be run with the system for which it was written and requires a copy of the appropriate Core Rulebook to play.Using all four of these adventures, a GM can create a cohesive event that tells the story of the Fall of Solace from multiple different perspectives, revealing the many factors that contributed to the events slowly over the course of the four individual stories. Because these adventures were originally written for use at a convention, each one includes notes on the time that should be devoted to given sections. If the GM wishes to run one of these adventures in a typical four to six hour convention timeslot, these notes can be useful; if the GM is not under any time restrictions, however, he should feel free to pace the adventure as he sees fit based on the group and other circumstances.

HB Blurb: "Today we face those who betrayed our predecessors. Today we bring death to those who turned from the light of the Emperor and broke faith with their brothers. Today we bring honour to those who came before us as we lay low these traitors! For Vilamus! For Guilliman! For the Emperor!"   
–Brother-Captain Haeron of the Marines Errant The brethren of the Deathwatch are the champions of humanity, the elite of the elite, and the very best the thousand and more Chapters of the Adeptus Astartes can produce. But while many Battle-Brothers are drawn from the most well known Chapters—the Blood Angels, the Space Wolves, the Ultramarines, and others of the First Founding—still more hail from lesser known bodies, the Successors of the great Legions. Some of these Chapters are every bit as famous as their celebrated progenitors, while others are all but unheralded. Nevertheless, all are heroes. Honour the Chapter is a supplement for Deathwatch that provides a wealth of options for players interested in characters drawn from Chapters created during the Second or subsequent Foundings. This comprehensive tome contains new character creation rules, a wealth of relics unique to each Chapter, and plenty of guidance and adventure seeds for Game Masters."

HB Blurb: Twilight Crusade is an adventure in three parts that focuses on the actions of Vir Modren and the politicking between his vassals. It takes the Explorers on a Grand Endeavour into the heart of Modren's Realm, alongside the acolytes of an ardent Inquisitor and his unexpected allies—a hunter cadre of Tau—from the far-flung reaches of the galaxy. The Explorers must venture deep into Modren's domain and negotiate the power-struggles of his many followers in order to gain entry to his personal fortress, where they can confront him directly. The three chapters of this adventure form a Grand Endeavour that provides the GM with a framework to gauge the progress and success of the Explorers as they venture into Modren's Realm and navigate the intrigues of Modren's vassals. This Endeavour can be modified to suit the GM's needs and broken down into smaller sections or padded out with new goals depending on the actions of the Explorers. A detailed breakdown of the Grand Endeavour's objectives can be found at the end of each chapter of the adventure. In addition, this adventure gives GMs the perfect opportunity to incorporate the content of the Tau Character Guide, as the warriors of that xenos race are featured extensively throughout.

HB Blurb: In this adventure for Rogue Trader, the Explorers delve deep into the ancient secrets of Solace. Solace was colonised by the Imperium in the final hours of the Angevin Crusade to unite the Calixis Sector, but its secrets wind perilously back into times forgotten by all but the most ancient. There have always been dark tales in Solace's mines about the things that dwell beneath the world's parched surface, but there have also been whispers of fortunes beyond the comprehension of any mortal. These whispers have spread far and wide and have reached the ears of a daring Rogue Trader, a warrior-privateer who braves the dangers of the unknown in the name of incalculable wealth and glory. Now, an avid group of Explorers journey to Solace, delving deep into an ancient chasm that contains strange relics of forgotten aeons. But when a cataclysm rocks the world of Solace, the Explorers find themselves facing a terrible threat that is not pleased about its rude awakening. Originally written for use at Gen Con Indy 2013, Binding Contracts, Falling Star, Shedding Light, and Savaging Solace are adventures for Warhammer 40,000 Roleplaying. The four linked scenarios concern the fate of the Imperial world of Solace. While each adventure stands on its own as a complete module suitable for immediate play, a group that plays all four adventures will spot the connections between the events as they transpire around the hive world of Solace.

HB Blurb: On the hunt to discover the cause of vanishing settlements and increased xenos sightings, you and your fellow Explorers are thrust on a perilous journey. A great beast has awakened from beyond the edges of the Koronus Expanse, hungering to fulfill its dark purpose. Before you and your fellow Explorers can attempt to seek it out and ultimately destroy it, you must uncover what and where it is. Finding the answer is a nearly impossible undertaking, pitting you against an infamous pirate lord blessed by Chaos. Citadel of Skulls, the second adventure in The Warpstorm Triology for Rogue Trader, can be played as a standalone adventure or connected to the events introduced in The Frozen Reaches. Prepare to attempt the ultimate heist: stealing a priceless artefact from the vault of Karrad Vall. No sane person has ever risked entering the Faceless Lord's inner sanctum, let alone stealing from him...until you. Plot your course through Vall's dark cathedral, past quivering slaves and brutal enemies, bloody chambers, and the ossuaries full of bones that give the Citadel its name. And once you reach the Casket of Secrets you'll meet "the Archivist." An epic adventure of exploration, combat, and acquisition of wealth, Citadel of Skulls will be a suspenseful and thrilling journey. Will you be able to withstand the voyage?

HB Blurb: Rogue Traders are accustomed to earning their livings in the grey areas of the law, but a few brave or foolhardy captains take it a step further... A supplement for Rogue Trader, Hostile Acquisitions provides players and GMs will find all they need to run a campaign on the far side of Imperial Law. From new characters and equipment to creating nemeses and running games based on criminal enterprise, Hostile Acquisitions is an invaluable resource on those Rogue Traders who are more rogue than trader. Hostile Acquisitions introduces some particularly devious options for players and GMs. Characters gain alternate career ranks, such as the Swashbucker, the House Operative, and the Cold Trader. These new alternate career ranks are highly flavourful, and allow you to make a character with a distinctively "scoundrel" bent. GMs can craft custom adversaries for their groups with the Nemesis Origin Path. You'll also find gear and starship upgrades to facilitate piracy and smuggling, a section on Imperial adversaries and details on Imperial Law, guidelines on how to run a "con" game, and a list of mythical treasures waiting to be "liberated."
