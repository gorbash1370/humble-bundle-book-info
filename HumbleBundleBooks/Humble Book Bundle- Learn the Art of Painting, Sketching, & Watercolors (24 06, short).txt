HB Blurb: In The Wood Burn Book, Rachel Strauss (@woodburncorner) teaches you everything you’ll need to know to master pyrography, whether you’re brand new to the hobby or you’ve been “writing with fire” for years.

This essential guide opens with a brief background to the art of wood burning, a list of tools and how to use them, basic techniques that can be used over and over again, and even what to burn and how to be safe doing it. You will also find a detailed explanation of the process from start to finish, with patterns, techniques for lettering and adding color, as well as dozens of projects ready for gifting, including picture frames, cutting boards, coasters, cards, wooden spoons, and jewelry.

Above all, Strauss has created the book she wished she had when she first discovered pyrography: a simple guide that quickly gets the reader successfully burning. With the right tools and a little time, you’ll be able to create meaningful handmade gifts without breaking the bank. Whether it’s to create a family name sign as a housewarming gift for newlyweds, or customize baby blocks for a new little one, wood burning is the versatile hobby that can be used time and time again to create memorable gifts for all of life’s occasions.

In addition, wood burning is a practice in mindfulness, requiring patience and focus to awaken the senses and calm the mind.

Mastering the art of writing with fire begins with the ability to follow a line. If you can trace, you can burn.

You also learn how to render characters in many different dynamic action poses, such as flying, spinning, punching, and jumping, as well as how to express each character’s emotions through facial expressions. The cast of characters includes wizards, ogres, werewolves, winged avengers, goblins, aliens, enchantresses, barbarians, robots and more. Author Glenn Fabry is a successful comic book and fantasy artist who has spent many years working in this field including work for both DC and Marvel Comics.

HB Blurb: A good sketch starts with good bones.The fourth book in the Urban Sketching Handbook series uses drawings and simple steps to explain the often challenging and overwhelming concepts of perspective in practical and useful ways for on-site sketching. Most books are either too abstract or don't provide enough information that relates to what you actually do when you're out in the busy, wide world about to start a drawing. Where do you start? How do you edit what you see to flatten and shrink it onto your paper? How does perspective work?The Urban Sketching Handbook: Understanding Perspective helps you learn to think like an architect, to draw buildings and spaces by reducing what you see to simple, basic shapes, then adding layers in simple steps, and finally finishing your sketch with detail, tone, and color--in accurate perspective. Full of helpful tips, architect and illustrator, Stephanie Bower even de-constructs sketches to show you how to create them! Once you understand perspective, it will change the way you see the world--you'll see perspective everywhere.Some of the key concepts explored in this volume are:- Basic Terms- Basic Spatial Principles- Types of Perspective- Building a Sketch in Layers- Special Conditions
