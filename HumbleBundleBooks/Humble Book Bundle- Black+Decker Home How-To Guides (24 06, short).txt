HB Blurb: The Hardworking Home presents a wide range of achievable home improvements that will help you upgrade your home to better meet your needs in this shifting world. From home office to home school to home entertaining, today’s households have necessarily become functional microcosms of society. Before the pandemic, less than five percent of full-time employees worked remotely from home. At the height of the outbreak, more than half did. And even when the dust has settled, it is estimated that at least a quarter of us will be performing our jobs from offices in our homes. Distance learning also will endure as an important educational tool. It makes sense to create a fun, vibrant atmosphere for entertaining ourselves and our guests within the safe confines of our homes. Some of the projects in The Hardworking Home are quite simple and others require a little more DIY experience. But the overriding commonality is that they have been curated with the forward-looking filter of making our lives better, more efficient, and more satisfying in a changing world landscape.
