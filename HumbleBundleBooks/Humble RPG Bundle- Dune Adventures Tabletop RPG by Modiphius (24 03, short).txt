HB Blurb: ARRAKIS: SOURCE OF THE SPICE.In the backwaters of the vast Imperium of humanity lies the hostile desert world of Arrakis. It is a deadly place, where no drop of rain falls and the people live a sparse existence in the baking cities of the northern pole. But Arrakis is the most important planet in the entire universe, for it is only here that you can find the spice melange.The spice is everything. To some, it is a way to extend life, to others a way to see into the future. It is the key to wealth and power in the Imperium, and many of the noble Houses will stop at nothing to control it in any way they can. The cities of Arrakeen and Carthag are full of agents and spies, all looking to gain advantage for their faction, and ready to kill to maintain the power of their masters. Will Arrakis be the place your characters prove the power of their House, or will their blood be spilled on the unforgiving sands?This collector's edition sourcebook for the Dune: Adventures in the Imperium roleplaying game, featuring a stunning foil embossed cover, takes you to the desert world of Arrakis and explores the secrets of the spice. Visit the hidden sietches of the Fremen to learn the mysteries of their culture. Walk without rhythm in the great deserts and perhaps see one of the incredible sandworms. Trade secrets with spies and agents in the bustling marketplace of Arrakeen or the alleys of Carthag. Arrakis is a planet of mysteries and danger, and those who underestimate it never leave.

HB Blurb: WHEN THE CENTER OF THE STORM DOES NOT MOVE, YOU ARE IN ITS PATH. -ANCIENT FREMEN WISDOMIn Coriolis Storm, you will learn that ‘shelter’ and ‘safety’ are very different things. Crossing the desert in an ornithopter leads the player characters to investigate an emergency assistance request from the Makreedi Weather Station, a remote, lightly-staffed research station deep in the deserts of Arrakis. A dangerous coriolis storm is approaching the station but the nature of the assistance request doesn’t seem entirely related to the storm. The player characters are closest to the station and the only group that could respond to the urgent request in time.After reaching the weather station, the player characters don’t have long before the storm reaches full strength, so time is immediately a factor. But all is not as it seems and the investigation may take long enough that the storm forces them to take shelter while potential dangers threaten their safety from within as well as without.Ultimately, the conclusion of the adventure comes when the players have uncovered the problem and dealt with (or survived) the threats, but several suggestions are provided throughout that allow gamemasters to tailor the adventure to their own campaigns, including alternative motives, antagonists, and outcomes which mean that players can be kept guessing until the final act.This standalone 24-page PDF adventure for Dune - Adventures in the Imperium is a location-based and time-sensitive investigation mission. Several tools are provided to aid the gamemaster in managing the flow of actions and events.You will need access to the game rules to play.

HB Blurb: THE WORST SORT OF PROTECTION IS CONFIDENCE.  THE BEST DEFENSE IS SUSPICION. -HASIMIR FENRINGIn Fatal Journey, identifying who committed a crime may not be as important as understanding why they did. The player characters are passengers on board a Guild Heighliner when a serious crime is committed. One of the other passengers is brutally murdered during the journey and until the murderer is found, the Heighliner is forced to hold its position and allow no one to leave. If the murderer were able to escape the Heighliner and go to ground planetside, it is unlikely they would ever be caught. As agents of a powerful House, the player characters may have skills that can help with the murder investigation and thus minimise the delay for themselves, the other passengers, and the powerful Spacing Guild itself.Unfortunately, they may discover that the situation is a lot more complex than it first seems. Is this just a straightforward murder or is there something else afoot? If the player characters simply want to get the Heighliner moving again, they need only find the murderer, but if they find out why the murder was committed they could be faced with a difficult decision. What should they do about it and who should they tell? Each choice comes with its own perils and rewards, but with no way to contact their House until the matter is resolved, the characters will need to make a decision on their own that could have far-reaching consequences for everyone involved.This stand-alone 19-page PDF adventure for Dune - Adventures in the Imperium is set entirely on board a Guild Heighliner and can easily be inserted into an existing campaign when player characters need to travel between worlds. The adventure is predominantly one of investigation and, although there is a threat of combat, it is possible to complete this adventure without resorting to violence.You will need access to the game rules to play. The Dune - Adventures in the Imperium Core Rulebook has these rules in their most complete form. However, the Agents of Dune campaign box set also contains all you need to play.Dune © Legendary.

HB Blurb: FOUR THINGS CANNOT BE HIDDEN - LOVE, SMOKE, A PILLAR OF FIRE, AND A MAN STRIDING ACROSS THE OPEN BLED.-FREMEN WISDOMIn Shaitan’s Bargain, who you choose to align with and the deals that you make can be just as dangerous as the desert itself. House Harkonnen are recruiting scouts and mercenaries to locate caves being used by the Fremen conducting raids on the spice harvesting operation in the Hagga Basin. The council of the poverty-stricken pyon village of Holfa takes a gamble on improving its fortunes by sponsoring the recruitment of agents on behalf of the Harkonnen, and the recruitment drive goes out around the village and beyond, even as far as Arrakeen. The player characters answer that call for reasons of their own, and learn that the mission is to map and explore the caves beneath Observatory Mountain and seek out where the Fremen may be hiding. The team must make an arduous trek through the Broken Land where heat, thirst and other desert dangers may threaten their task almost before it’s begun. However, soon after arrival at the caves, a discovery and a meeting might change the outcome of the mission. Between House Harkonnen, the village of Holfa, and the Fremen, the conclusion of the adventure will depend on alliances and deals made, and which side (if any) the player characters have aligned themselves with. The fate of Holfa and its population lies in the hands of the player characters and how they choose to complete their business with the Harkonnen. This standalone 20-page PDF adventure for Dune - Adventures in the Imperium is set before the arrival of House Atreides on Arrakis, but includes guidance on adapting it to other eras. The adventure includes a number of opportunities to influence NPC factions which, ultimately, affects the conclusion of the adventure. Although the threat of combat is never far away, it is possible to complete this adventure without resorting to violence.You will need access to the game rules to play.
