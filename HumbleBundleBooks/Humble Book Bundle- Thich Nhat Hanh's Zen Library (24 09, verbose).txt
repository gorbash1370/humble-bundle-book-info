HB Blurb: FROM THE FATHER OF MINDFULNESS: Thich Nhat Hanh offers mindfulness practices and inspiration for acknowledging and transforming suffering—not running away from it.Includes guidance on using mindful breathing and deep concentration to find true joy!Thich Nhat Hanh acknowledges that because suffering can feel so bad, we try to run away from it or cover it up by consuming. We find something to eat or turn on the television. But unless we’re able to face our suffering, we can’t be present and available to life, and happiness will continue to elude us. 
 
Nhat Hanh shares how the practices of stopping, mindful breathing, and deep concentration can generate the energy of mindfulness within our daily lives. With that energy, we can embrace pain and calm it down, instantly bringing a measure of freedom and a clearer mind. 
 
No Mud, No Lotus introduces ways to be in touch with suffering without being overwhelmed by it. "When we know how to suffer," Nhat Hanh says, "we suffer much, much less." With his signature clarity and sense of joy, Thich Nhat Hanh helps us recognize the wonders inside us and around us that we tend to take for granted and teaches us the art of happiness.

HB Blurb: A radical new interpretation of the Buddha’s most important, most studied teaching, the Heart Sutra—from the great Zen Master and peace activist behind The Miracle of Mindfulness. 
 
In September 2014, Thich Nhat Hanh completed a profound and beautiful new English translation of the Prajñaparamita Heart Sutra, one of the most important and well-known Buddhist sutras. 
  
The Heart Sutra is recited daily in Mahayana temples and practice centers throughout the world. This new translation came about because Thich Nhat Hanh believes that the patriarch who originally compiled the Heart Sutra was not sufficiently skillful with his use of language to capture the intention of the Buddha’s teachings—and has resulted in fundamental misunderstandings of the central tenets of Buddhism for almost 2,000 years. 
  
In The Other Shore, Thich Nhat Hanh provides the new translation with commentaries based on his interpretation. Revealing the Buddha’s original intention and insight makes clear what it means to transcend duality and pairs of opposites, such as birth and death, and to touch the ultimate reality and the wisdom of nondiscrimination. By helping to demystify the term “emptiness,” the Heart Sutra is made more accessible and understandable.

This stunning poetry collection explores these lesser-known facets of Nhat Hanh’s life, revealing not only his path to becoming a Zen meditation teacher but his skill as a poet, his achievements as a peace activist, and his experiences as a young refugee. 
 
Through more than 50 poems spanning several decades, Nhat Hanh reveals the stories of his past—from his childhood in war-torn Vietnam to the beginnings of his own spiritual journey—and shares his ideas on how we can come together to create a more peaceful, compassionate world. Uplifting, insightful, and profound, Call Me By My True Names is at once an exquisite work of poetry and a portrait of one of the world’s greatest Zen masters and peacemakers.

HB Blurb: World-renowned Zen monk Thich Nhat Hanh champions a more mindful, spiritual approach to protecting nature and limiting climate change—one that recognizes people and planet as one and the same. 
  
While many experts point to the enormous complexity in addressing issues ranging from the destruction of ecosystems to the loss of millions of species, Thich Nhat Hanh identifies one key issue as having the potential to create a tipping point. He believes that we need to move beyond the concept of the “environment,” as it leads people to experience themselves and Earth as two separate entities and to see the planet only in terms of what it can do for them. 
 
Here, Thich Nhat Hanh points to the lack of meaning and connection in peoples’ lives as being the cause of our addiction to consumerism. He deems it vital that we recognize and respond to the stress we are putting on the Earth if civilization is to survive. Rejecting the conventional economic approach, Thich Nhat Hanh shows that mindfulness and a spiritual revolution are needed to protect nature and limit climate change. 
 
Love Letter to the Earth is a hopeful book that gives us a path to follow by showing that change is possible only with the recognition that people and the planet are ultimately one and the same.

HB Blurb: Thich Nhat Hanh pulls from 50 classic Buddhist verses to present the basic teachings of Buddhist applied psychology, exploring the true nature of our feelings and perceptions. 
  
Based on the 50 verses on the nature of consciousness taken from the great 5th-century Buddhist master Vasubandhu and the teachings of the Avatamsaka Sutra, Thich Nhat Hanh focuses on the direct experience of recognizing, embracing, and looking deeply into the nature of our feelings and perceptions. 
 
Presenting the basic teachings of Buddhist applied psychology, Understanding Our Mind shows us how our mind is like a field, where every kind of seed is planted—seeds of suffering, anger, happiness, and peace. The quality of our life depends on the quality of the seeds in our mind. If we know how to water seeds of joy and transform seeds of suffering, then understanding, love, and compassion will flower. Vietnamese Zen Master Thuong Chieu said, “When we understand how our mind works, the practice becomes easy.”

HB Blurb: Zen Master Thich Nhat Hanh’s commentary on Nagarjuna’s Treatise on the Middle Way—one of the most famous Buddhist texts in existence. 
 
Nagarjuna is a giant in the Buddhist canon, thought to be the greatest Buddhist philosopher after the Buddha. He lived in southern India in the 2nd century CE. Cracking the Walnut contains the text of Nagarjuna’s Treatise on the Middle Way (Mulamadhyamakakarika), defending the essential premise that all things have the nature of emptiness, they have no self-nature, but are in a constant process of change and interrelationship with one another.Weaving Nagarjuna’s text with commentary by Thich Nhat Hanh, taken from talks given at two 3-month-long retreats, helps us bring these teachings into our daily life. They are strong teachings, designed to break through all metaphysical speculation. To a greater or lesser extent, we all have notions and ideas about life. Sometimes our ideas can contribute to the advancement of humanity, but the problem comes when we are caught in our ideas and believe them to be the absolute truth. When people believe that something is the absolute truth, they may be ready to fight, kill, or die for it. This brings about polarization, deep division, and suffering in ourselves, our society, community, and family. This is not the way ahead for humanity. This book helps us let go of our ideas and go in the direction of understanding and compassion.

HB Blurb: WHY DO WE PRAY? Thich Nhat Hanh explores the power of prayer in Buddhist and other spiritual traditions, re-envisioning it as an open, inclusive practice that creates healthy lives through awareness and intention. 
 
Life’s fast pace leaves little room for reflection and attention to the present moment. To seek relief from stress and pain, we often turn to consuming in order to forget our suffering, but we soon find that material wealth is not enough to bring true happiness, and always leaves us searching for something more. The Energy of Prayer shows how prayer and meditation can offer a beneficial way to reconnect with ourselves while satisfying the basic human need to make a connection with something larger than our everyday self. Whether used as a daily practice, during times of crisis, or to express gratitude prayer serves many functions, and does not need to be tied to a particular religious or spiritual affiliation to be effective. 
 
Prayer has played an increasing role in the practice that Thich Nhat Hanh offers to his students. Rather than viewing it as dogmatic obligation, Buddhism views prayer as a form of energy, a way of communicating with one's higher self, one's ancestors, or one’s God. Prayer is redefined not as being about asking some external force for what we need but about creating an internal environment in which it is easier to manifest positive outcomes in our lives. The Energy of Prayer includes visualization and breathing exercises and concludes with a rich sampling of a broad range of prayers, chants and invocations from the Buddhist tradition.

HB Blurb: Join Zen Master Thich Nhat Hanh as he explores 5 essential mindfulness practices that offer a blueprint for healthy, compassionate living—no matter your spiritual path or background. 
  
The Five Mindfulness Trainings (also referred to as “Precepts”)—not to kill, steal, commit adultery, lie, or take intoxicants—are the basic statement of ethics and morality in Buddhism. Zen Master and peace activist Thich Nhat Hanh argues eloquently for their applicability in our daily lives and on a global scale. Nhat Hanh discusses the value and meaning of each precept, offering insights into the role that it could play in our changing society. 
 
Thich Nhat Hanh calls the trainings a “diet for a mindful society”. With this book, he offers a Buddhist contribution to the current thinking on how we can come together to define secular, moral guidelines that will allow us to explore and sustain a sane, compassionate, and healthy way of living. The Five Mindfulness Trainings offer a path to restoring meaning and value in our world—whether called virtues, ethics, moral conduct, or precepts they are guidelines for living without bringing harm to others.

HB Blurb: A beautiful edition of an essential Buddhist text, the Diamond Sutra—with Thich Nhat Hanh’s own diamond-sharp insights on living harmoniously with our environment, communities, and families. 
  
The Diamond Sutra, a mainstay of the Mahayana tradition, has fascinated Buddhists for centuries because of its insights into dualism and illusion: the “diamond” can cut through any obstacle on the road to enlightenment. 
  
In The Diamond That Cuts Through Illusion, the Buddha and his disciple Subhuti teach us how to cut through our dualistic ways of looking at the world in order to have a deeper contact with the wondrous reality that is inside and all around us. In his lively and penetrating commentaries, Thich Nhat Hanh shows us how this understanding leads to a deep reverence for the environment, and he applies the Buddha’s teachings to our own experience, giving practical examples from community and family life, couple relationships, and social service.

HB Blurb: Thich Nhat Hanh at his most personal and endearing—“a rare record of his unselfing, which made him himself: the monk who brought mindfulness to the world” (The Marginalian).
Read the journals of Thich Nhat Hanh as he reflects on being young man in the United States and Vietnam, just as his home country plunged into war. 
 
“It isn't likely that this collection of journal entries, which I'm calling Fragrant Palm Leaves, will pass the censors... I'll leave Vietnam tomorrow." Thus, Thich Nhat Hanh begins his May 11, 1966 journal entry. After leaving Vietnam, he was exiled for calling for peace, and was unable to visit his homeland again until 2004. In the interim, Thich Nhat Hanh continued to practice and teach in the United States and Europe, and became one of the world’s most respected spiritual leaders. 
 
But when these journals are written, all of that is still to come. Fragrant Palm Leaves reveals a vulnerable and questioning young man, a student and teaching assistant at Princeton and Columbia Universities from 1962-1963, homesick and reflecting on the many difficulties he and his fellow monks faced at home trying to make Buddhism relevant to the people’s needs. We also follow Thich Nhat Hanh as he returns to Vietnam in 1964, and helps establish the movement known as Engaged Buddhism. 
 
A rare window into the early life of a spiritual icon, Fragrant Palm Leaves provides a model of how to live fully, with awareness, during a time of change and upheaval.

HB Blurb: The world-renowned Zen Buddhist teacher and author of No Mud, No Lotus presents mindfulness and meditation as tools for examining—and solving—both personal and global challenges. 
  
In Touching Peace, Thich Nhat Hanh expands the teachings on practicing the art of mindful living begun in the best-selling Being Peace by giving specific, practical instructions on extending our meditation practice into our daily lives. Thich Nhat Hanh reminds us to focus on what is refreshing and healing within and all around us—and how, paired with the practice of mindful breathing, it can be used as the basis for examining the roots of war and violence, alcoholism and drug abuse, and social alienation. 
 
Included are classic Thich Nhat Hanh practices and teachings such as the conflict resolution tool of the Peace Treaty; his thoughts on a “diet for a mindful society” based on his interpretation of the 5 Mindfulness Trainings; and his early writings on the environment. With Touching Peace, Nhat Hanh shares his vision for rebuilding society through strengthening our families and communities, and realizing the ultimate dimension of reality in each act of our daily lives.
