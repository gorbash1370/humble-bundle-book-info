HB Blurb: Ever since computers began beating us at chess, they’ve been getting better at a wide range of human activities, from writing songs and generating news articles to helping doctors provide healthcare.Deep learning is the source of many of these breakthroughs, and its remarkable ability to find patterns hiding in data has made it the fastest growing field in artificial intelligence (AI). Digital assistants on our phones use deep learning to understand and respond intelligently to voice commands; automotive systems use it to safely navigate road hazards; online platforms use it to deliver personalized suggestions for movies and books—the possibilities are endless.Deep Learning: A Visual Approach is for anyone who wants to understand this fascinating field in depth, but without any of the advanced math and programming usually required to grasp its internals. If you want to know how these tools work, and use them yourself, the answers are all within these pages. And, if you’re ready to write your own programs, there are also plenty of supplemental Python notebooks in the accompanying GitHub repository to get you going.The book’s conversational style, extensive color illustrations, illuminating analogies, and real-world examples expertly explain the key concepts in deep learning, including:How text generators create novel stories and articlesHow deep learning systems learn to play and win at human gamesHow image classification systems identify objects or people in a photoHow to think about probabilities in a way that’s useful to everyday lifeHow to use the machine learning techniques that form the core of modern AIIntellectual adventurers of all kinds can use the powerful ideas covered in Deep Learning: A Visual Approach to build intelligent systems that help us better understand the world and everyone who lives in it. It’s the future of AI, and this book allows you to fully envision it.Get every figure in the book, dozens of Python notebooks, and three bonus chapters, all for free and for you to use any way you like, at the book’s GitHub page.

HB Blurb: Deep learning is everywhere, making this powerful driver of artificial intelligence something more STEM professionals need to know. Learning which library commands to use is one thing, but to truly understand the discipline, you need to grasp the mathematical concepts that make it tick. This book will give you a working knowledge of topics in probability, statistics, linear algebra, and differential calculus—the essential math needed to make deep learning comprehensible, which is key to practicing it successfully.Each of the four subfields are contextualized with Python code and hands-on, real-world examples that bridge the gap between pure mathematics and its applications in deep learning. Chapters build upon one another, with foundational topics such as Bayes’ theorem followed by more advanced concepts, like training neural networks using vectors, matrices, and derivatives of functions. You’ll ultimately put all this math to use as you explore and implement deep learning algorithms, including backpropagation and gradient descent – the foundational algorithms that have enabled the AI revolution.You’ll learn:The rules of probability, probability distributions, and Bayesian probabilityThe use of statistics for understanding datasets and evaluating modelsHow to manipulate vectors and matrices, and use both to move data through a neural networkHow to use linear algebra to implement principal component analysis and singular value decompositionHow to apply improved versions of gradient descent, like RMSprop, Adagrad, and AdadeltaOnce you understand the core math concepts presented throughout this book through the lens of AI programming, you’ll have foundational know-how to easily follow and work with deep learning.

HB Blurb: Dive Into Algorithms is a wide-ranging, Pythonic tour of many of the world’s most interesting algorithms. With little more than a bit of computer programming experience and basic high-school math, you’ll explore standard computer science algorithms for searching, sorting, and optimization; human-based algorithms that help us determine how to catch a baseball or eat the right amount at a buffet; and advanced algorithms like ones used in machine learning and artificial intelligence. You’ll even explore how ancient Egyptians and Russian peasants used algorithms to multiply numbers, how the ancient Greeks used them to find greatest common divisors, and how Japanese scholars in the age of samurai designed algorithms capable of generating magic squares.You’ll explore algorithms that are useful in pure mathematics and learn how mathematical ideas can improve algorithms. You’ll learn about an algorithm for generating continued fractions, one for quick calculations of square roots, and another for generating seemingly random sets of numbers.You’ll also learn how to:Use algorithms to debug code, maximize revenue, schedule tasks, and create decision treesMeasure the efficiency and speed of algorithmsGenerate Voronoi diagrams for use in various geometric applicationsUse algorithms to build a simple chatbot, win at board games, or solve sudoku puzzlesWrite code for gradient ascent and descent algorithms that can find the maxima and minima of functionsUse simulated annealing to perform global optimizationBuild a decision tree to predict happiness based on a person’s characteristicsOnce you’ve finished this book you’ll understand how to code and implement important algorithms as well as how to measure and optimize their performance, all while learning the nitty-gritty details of today’s most powerful algorithms.

HB Blurb: Lisp has been hailed as the world’s most powerful programming language, but its cryptic syntax and academic reputation can be enough to scare off even experienced programmers. Those dark days are finally over—Land of Lisp brings the power of functional programming to the people!With his brilliantly quirky comics and out-of-this-world games, longtime Lisper Conrad Barski teaches you the mysteries of Common Lisp. You’ll start with the basics, like list manipulation, I/O, and recursion, then move on to more complex topics like macros, higher order programming, and domain-specific languages. Then, when your brain overheats, you can kick back with an action-packed comic book interlude!Along the way you’ll create (and play) games like Wizard Adventure, a text adventure with a whiskey-soaked twist, and Grand Theft Wumpus, the most violent version of Hunt the Wumpus the world has ever seen.You’ll learn to:Master the quirks of Lisp’s syntax and semanticsWrite concise and elegant functional programsUse macros, create domain-specific languages, and learn other advanced Lisp techniquesCreate your own web server, and use it to play browser-based gamesPut your Lisp skills to the test by writing brain-melting games like Dice of Doom and Orc BattleWith Land of Lisp, the power of functional programming is yours to wield.

HB Blurb: It’s all in the name: Learn You a Haskell for Great Good! is a hilarious, illustrated guide to this complex functional language. Packed with the author’s original artwork, pop culture references, and most importantly, useful example code, this book teaches functional fundamentals in a way you never thought possible.You’ll start with the kid stuff: basic syntax, recursion, types and type classes. Then once you’ve got the basics down, the real black belt master-class begins: you’ll learn to use applicative functors, monads, zippers, and all the other mythical Haskell constructs you’ve only read about in storybooks.As you work your way through the author’s imaginative (and occasionally insane) examples, you’ll learn to:Laugh in the face of side effects as you wield purely functional programming techniquesUse the magic of Haskell’s “laziness” to play with infinite sets of dataOrganize your programs by creating your own types, type classes, and modulesUse Haskell’s elegant input/output system to share the genius of your programs with the outside worldShort of eating the author’s brain, you will not find a better way to learn this powerful language than reading Learn You a Haskell for Great Good!Bonus: ebook is in color!
