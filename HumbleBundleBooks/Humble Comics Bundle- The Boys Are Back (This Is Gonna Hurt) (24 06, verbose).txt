HB Blurb: The war is over and the world is saved. The supes have been beaten down so far they'll never get up again. So why would anyone want one hundred and eighteen metric tons of the only substance on earth that can kill them all stone dead? Bad days start coming thick and fast, as the Boys are caught in the last throes of the battle they were recruited to fight so long ago. Hughie, all on his own and out of luck, finds himself walking down one last bloody trail- and the truth he finds waiting for him at the end of it will be nothing short of shattering. Billy Butcher's vengeance comes full circle, in this twelfth and final entry in the story of The Boys. The Boys Vol. 12: The Bloody Doors Off TP contains issues #66-72 as well as a complete cover gallery!

HB Blurb: Out of Dynamite Entertainment's critically acclaimed title, The Boys, comes a special story featuring everyone's favorite pint-sized Scotsman, Hughie, with The Boys: Highland Laddie, written by Garth Ennis, with covers by Darick Robertson and art by Herogasm artist John McCrea. Mind reeling from recent events in The Boys, Wee Hughie heads home to Auchterladle - the semi-idyllic Scottish seaside town where he grew up. All Hughie wants is some time to himself, to return to the bosom of family and friends, and get his head together after two years of unimaginable chaos. But our hero's luck has always been more cloud than silver lining, and the familiar surroundings he craves are not all they might be. You can go home again, but with old pals warped beyond recognition and strangers in town up to no good, whether or not you should is another matter entirely. Collecting issues #1-6 of the Highland Laddie series, along with a complete cover gallery.

HB Blurb: The sixth Dynamite collection of Garth Ennis and Darick Robertson's The Boys is here, with The Boys, Vol. 6: Self-Preservation Society! You can only maim and murder so many superheroes before someone decides to do something about it, and in The Boys' case that means Payback - a superteam of unimaginable power, second only to the mighty Seven. Pulping teenage supes is one thing, but how will our heroes fare against Soldier Boy, Mind-Droid, Swatto, the Crimson Countess, and the Nazi juggernaut known as Stormfront? Blood flies and bones shatter, as Butcher and company meet fire with fire. And in the origin tales of Mother's Milk, the Frenchman and the Female, Hughie learns of the strange paths by which this disparate trio came to join The Boys. From tragedy in Harlem to the slaughter on the Brooklyn Bridge, from the festival of Les Saints De Haw-Haw to the horror lurking under Tokyo, this is a journey of discovery like no other - with only the flickering lamp of insanity to light the way. The Boys, Vol. 6: Self-Preservation Society collects issues 31-38 of the New York Times Best-Selling series by Garth Ennis, Darick Robertson and Judge Dredd co-creator, Carlos Ezquerra, and features all of the covers by Robertson!

HB Blurb: They're outcasts. Renegades. Rogues. Outsiders. They're the world's most profitable superheroes. They're the G-Men. But all is not well with mysterious millionaire John Godolkin's band of misfits. Silver Kincaid, one of the original G-Men, has just committed suicide in the most public and grotesque way imaginable. That's not good news for Vought-American's number one franchise, with G-Force, G-Coast, G-Style, G-Wiz, the G-Brits and the G-Nomads all depending on their slice of the G-pie. There's far too much at stake for anyone to go poking around the G-Mansion now. Who knows what dirty secrets might be waiting down there in the dark?

HB Blurb: The third Dynamite collection of Garth Ennis and Darick Robertson's "The Boys" is here! In "Good For The Soul" (issues 15-18): Hughie visits The Legend, determined to find out more about The Boys- their history, their personalities, and their mysterious hidden agenda. Meanwhile, Annie January (alias Starlight) has her own doubts about membership of The Seven. This storyline also reveals a little more about the other members of the team- beginning with Butcher, and his relationship with CIA director Susan Rayner. In "I Tell You No Lie, G.I." (issues 19-22): Wee Hughie sits down with The Legend to get the lowdown on the Boys and their enemies from the very beginning. All will be revealed, or at least that's what Hughie's expecting- who started it all, who did what to whom, why the Twin Towers are still up and the Brooklyn Bridge is down. Meanwhile, Butcher and the others meet their sparring partners... and deep down in the bowels of their hovering headquarters, Annie and A-Train discover the Seven's darkest secret. Also includes a complete cover gallery! Recommended for Mature Readers.
